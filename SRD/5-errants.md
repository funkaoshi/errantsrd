# Errants

## Creating an Errant

### Determine Attributes

To generate an Errant’s attributes, roll four four-sided dice (4D4) and
record the scores for each Attribute in this order: phys, skill, mind,
pres. Afterwards, you may choose to swap the scores of two attributes
(e.g. if you rolled a 9 for phys and a 13 for mind you may wish to swap
them, instead having 13 phys and 9 mind).

### Choose Ancestry

Choose what type of creature your Errant is. This could be a more
traditional fantasy creature like a dwarf or an elf or a halfling, or
perhaps a slime or a Humpty Dumpty or the sentient manifestation of a
bad breakup. Aside from the abilities listed below, the Guide may
consider the situational benefits and drawbacks of your Ancestry, when
appropriate.

#### Tough

(Dwarves, orcs, etc.) Once per session, when you would be reduced to 0
HP, you may choose to be reduced to 1 HP instead. Minimum starting age:
2D20+10.

#### Arcane

(Elves, demons, etc.) Once per session, you can attempt to perform a
minor magic related to your Ancestry: roll 2D6 and add your Renown, on a
10+ you succeed, on a 7-9 a complication occurs, on a 6 or lower,
failure. Minimum starting age: 3D20+10.

#### Cunning

(Halflings, goblins, etc.) Once per session, you may reroll any D20
roll. Minimum starting age: D20+10.

#### Adaptable

(Humans, half-humans, etc.) Once per session, you may choose to use one
Attribute for a Check in lieu of another. Minimum starting age: D10+10.

### Keepsake & Failed Profession

Roll on the Keepsakes table (p. 58) to determine a unique random
starting item, which does not fill an Item Slot (consider this item an
extension of the Errant themselves, if you need a reason why this is
so).

Roll on the Failed Professions table (p. 62) or choose a background for
what your Errant did before they became an adventurer. Your Failed
Profession may alter the DV, Position, and/or Impact of Checks relating
to it, at the Guide's discretion.

### Choose Archetype

Choose one of the four Archetypes to play as.

#### The Violent

Capable of great Feats in combat.

#### The Deviant

Unsurpassed in their proficiencies.

#### The Occult

Casters of Sorceries and creators of Grimoires.

#### The Zealot

Agents of their Covenants empowered to perform Miracles.

Graphic: Three nervous Errants ascend a staircase. The one in front has
pointy ears poking out between their bandana and their pointed cap.
They're wearing a gambeson, holding a longsword, and looking straight
ahead. The second Errant, carrying a massive backpack, grips the railing
and looks around them nervously. The last Errant in line is shorter than
the rest. They hold a dagger at the ready, and are looking up with their
one good eye—the other covered by a bandana. The staircase is adorned
with railing posts carved into Hellenistic scupltures of nude women. The
wall behind and above the adventurers is dense with framed paintings: a
glaring gremlin, an evilly grinning fop, the grim reaper with scythe,
several landscapes, and one frolicking nude.

## Select Starting Equipment

All Errants start with:

-   A backpack.
-   A medium weapon of their choice (1 Item Slot).
-   A quiver of ammunition, if needed (1 Item Slot, Depletion 2).
-   A bedroll (1 Item Slot).
-   A torch (½ Item Slot, Burn 2).
-   50’ of rope (½ Item Slot).
-   A mess kit (¼ Item Slot).
-   A tinderbox (¼ Item Slot).
-   Rations (¼ Item Slot, Depletion 1)
-   A waterskin (¼ Item Slot).
-   4 Supply (¼ Item Slot each).

Graphic: A smiling Errant with wooden club gripped in both hands, ready
to swing.

In addition to equipment based on your Archetype.

-   The Violent starts with either a heavy weapon (2 Item Slots) or a
    small (1 Item Slot, 4 Blocks) or large shield (2 Item Slots,
-   6 Blocks).
-   The Deviant starts with either burglar’s tools (1 Item Slot) or an
    alchemist’s kit (1 Item Slot).
-   The Occult starts with the four Grimoires of their starting
    Sorceries (1/4 Item Slot each).
-   The Zealot starts with one of their Relics (1 Item Slot).

## Note Languages Known 

All Errants can speak whatever the common language of their region is,
as well as any language related to their Ancestry. In addition, for
every point of mind above 10, an Errant may specify another language
known. This may be anything they wish. It could be “goblin”, or “doors”,
or “the bitter sexual tension between foes”, or “the flowers that grow
in my mother’s garden”. The more specific the language is, the better an
Errant is at communicating with that thing.

Conversely, communication may be attempted with a character whose
language is not quite the same but similar to another language one
knows, but the greater the difference, the less effective communication
is. One may speak to wolves in a general, if offensive manner, if one
speaks “dog”, but any wolf worth their salt would take dire offence at
being spoken to in “chihuahua”.

## Record Other Information

Finally, note any other important information an Errant may need to
know.

-   Their HP is equal to their phys.

-   How many Item Slots they have, which is equal to their phys.

-   Their SPD (both backpack on and off), which is equal to their skill
    minus Encumbrance.

-   Their Alignment, which starts at N, except for Errants of The Zealot
    Archetype who belong to Lawful or Chaotic Covenants, who start at
    either L1 or C1 respectively.

-   Their damage die and any other abilities granted to them by their
    Archetype.

    -   The Deviant should spend their Proficiency points.
    -   The Occult should generate their four starting Sorceries with
        the Guide.
    -   The Zealot should devise their Covenant with the Guide.

## Renown

The measure of an Errant’s fame, notoriety, and power is their Renown.
An Errant begins at Renown 1. If an Errant ever wishes to see if someone
has heard of them (if it is not already obvious), they may roll a D10
and attempt to roll equal or under their Renown; if they are successful,
their reputation precedes them.

An Errant increases their Renown by gaining experience (XP), as shown on
the table below.

When an Errant’s Renown increases, two of their attributes increase
by 1. The rest of the Company decides the first Attribute that
increases, based on their recent performance. After this, the Errant may
themselves decide the second Attribute that increases; they may not
select the same Attribute the Company selected.

An Errant gains 1 XP per penny they waste.

Wasting is any monetary transaction which is not an investment,
something which will give a return on value, either financially or
through use, or a necessity. A meal, for example, is not waste, but a
lavish banquet is.

In addition, Errants also gain XP when anything in which they have
invested is unintentionally destroyed or becomes unusable, even
temporarily. If a sword or piece of armour breaks, they gain XP. If a
ship they bought is reefed, they gain XP. If their burgeoning blink dog
walking business comes under threat, they gain XP.

| 7   | 126,000 |
| 8   | 254,000 |
| 9   | 510,000 |

## Adjutants 

When an Errant reaches Renown 2, they become notable enough that they
may, if they wish, attract an adjutant. This essentially turns one
Errant into two, as a player may control both their Errant and their
adjutant.

The adjutant always starts at Renown 1, and can never be the same Renown
as the Errant to whom they are attached. An Errant and their adjutant
divide XP among themselves, with the Errant receiving ¾ of the XP, and
the adjutant receiving the remaining ¼.

If the Errant an adjutant is attached to dies, the adjutant may assume
their Position, and may in turn attract an adjutant of their own.

An Errant may only ever have one adjutant in their lifetime, and should
they perish, they cannot be replaced.

Graphic: Four Errants stand in a small crowd. A horned and heavily
armored creature, nearly as broad as they are tall and wielding a
battleaxe half again as tall as they are. A diminutive woman wearing an
apron, triumphantly holding a waterskin aloft as smoke billows
voluminously from it. A lean figure in robes examining a smoking orb
with interest. Their small brow, wide eyes, gaunt features and two
prominent fangs are reminiscent of nosferatu. An older man with a
scraggly mustache and thick glasses. He wears a side-button jacket of
severe cut, and carries barber's tools. The lower half of his body is
spattered with mud...or blood. The crowd continues onto the next page.

## Rosters

Players are encouraged to maintain a roster of several Errants that they
can choose to play. Errants of high Renown may often find themselves
occupied for multiple Downtime Turns in important matters, and during
these periods a player can send their lower Renown Errants off on
adventures in their stead.

Players can pass items and information freely among the Errants in their
roster, provided they are in the same place in the game world.

Players may only swap control among Errants in their roster when it
makes sense to do so (e.g. generally not in the middle of an adventure),
and can only do so once per game session.

Graphic: A small crowd of four Errants, continuing from the previous
page. A short figure wearing muddy rags, their face obscured in a dark
hood save for a pair of brightly glowing eyes. They stand with arms
folded, and a weapon as large as they are strapped to their back. An
aristocratically dressed woman looks down at the small figure with
disinterest. Her hair is gathered into a decorative net, and two large
horns bedecked with rings sprout from her forehead. She carries an easel
and canvas under one arm, with several large rolls of paper behind her.
A freestanding slime creature, with four eyes and a grinning mouth that
drift only vaguely near their expected positions. The slime is filled
with all manner of detritus: a ring, a crowbar, an arrow, two flasks of
liquid, a shield, and a spear with a star of sharp spikes just beneath
its tip. The slime is being touched by a young woman with a thick braid
that drops down below her knees. She's looking at the strands of goo
dangling between her hand and the slime creature with an expression of
mild distress. In her other hand she clutches a pot, from which ferns
and flowers grow.

## The Violent

Graphic: A heavily plated figure, dark with shadow. The violent rests
her great heavy sword across one shoulder, and holds a circular shield
with a striking serpent crest in the other. A cloak of chainmail hangs
from beneath her armored plates, and if her face is uncovered beneath
her helm it is not visibe in the shadows.

**Damage Die** - D8

**Extra Attacks** - When you reach Renown 3, and every third time your
Renown increases thereafter, the number of Attack Rolls you can make
when you take an action to attack increases by one.

**Feats** - You have a number of combat dice, which are the same size as
your damage die. These combat dice can be expended to perform Feats.

The number of Feats you can use in one Initiative Turn is equal to the
number of Attack Rolls you can make.

At Renown 1 you have 2 combat dice. You gain an additional combat die
each time your Renown increases. Combat dice replenish after a night’s
Rest.

At Renown 1, you know these 3 Feats.

-   Smite - when you make an Attack Roll, you may roll a combat die and
    add it to your damage.
-   Grit - when you take damage, you may roll a combat die and reduce
    the incoming damage by the amount rolled.
-   Dash - when you move, you may roll a combat die and add the result
    to your movement roll.

At every even Renown level, you can learn a new Feat from the list
below, or devise your own with approval from the Guide:

-   Avenge - when an ally takes damage, you may expend a combat die and
    immediately make an Attack Roll against the enemy that targeted
    them.
-   Cleave - expend a combat die. This Initiative Turn, whenever you
    reduce an enemy to 0 HP, you may make another Attack Roll.
-   Command - roll a combat die. In place of one of your Attack Rolls,
    you allow one of your allies to make an Attack Roll, with a bonus to
    damage equal to the number rolled on your combat die.
-   Exert - expend a combat die. This Initiative Turn, you may make as
    many Attack Rolls as you wish, but each Attack Roll you make past
    your normal amount deals equal damage to you.
-   Goad - expend a combat die. This Initiative Turn, all enemies must
    target you.
-   Intimidate – roll a combat die. Your next Attack Roll causes enemies
    to make a Morale roll with a penalty equal to the number rolled on
    your combat die.
-   Protect - when an ally takes damage, you may roll a combat die and
    reduce the damage taken by the number rolled.
-   Resist - when you fail a Saving Throw, you may expend a combat die
    and re-roll it.
-   Strategise - roll a combat die. The next time you perform a gambit,
    the DV of the enemy’s Saving Throw is increased by the amount rolled
    on your combat die, and is made at dire Position and weak Impact.
-   Surge - expend a combat die. This Initiative Turn, you gain an
    additional action, which cannot be used to make an Attack Roll.

## The Deviant

|     |     |          |

| 9   | 1   | Skill+18 |

Graphic: The deviant slouches with an arm raised and round bells
balanced between their fingers. They are dressed in a puffy costume sewn
from multiple patterned fabrics and carry a pouch strung across their
shoulder. Their sunken eyes are visible behind a veil and bird's beak
mask.

**Damage Die** - D6

**Sneak Attack** - When you make an Attack Roll against someone unaware
of your presence, you make a sneak attack, rolling two damage dice, in
addition to any enhancement the attack may receive.

**Proficiencies** - You start with 2 Proficiency points at Renown 1, and
gain 1 Proficiency point each time your Renown increases.

A Proficiency point may be spent to gain expertise in any of the
following proficiencies, or a Proficiency of your own devising with
approval from the Guide. Expertise reduces the DV of all Checks (but not
Saving Throws) relating to that Proficiency by 2.

Spending an additional Proficiency point on a Proficiency grants you
mastery. This confers special abilities, and changes the Position of all
Checks relating to that Proficiency to shaky, and the Impact of all
Checks relating to that Proficiency to strong.

-   Anatomy - Expertise: (Alchemy, barber-surgery, cooking, autopsies,
    etc.)

    -   Mastery: Chemist – when you use an alchemist’s kit, you can
        store six alchemical components rather than four.

-   Awareness - Expertise: (investigating a room, checking for traps,
    detecting hidden characters, appraisal, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Alert – you may still act in an Initiative Turn even
        when surprised.

-   Engineering - Expertise: (disarming traps, mechanics, architecture
    and dungeoncraft, demolitions, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Locksmith – when Lockpicking, you may ignore the first
        jam.

-   Fitness - Expertise: (climbing, running, jumping, acrobatics, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Fleet-footed – as long as your Encumbrance is not
        greater than 4, it does not reduce your SPD.

-   Lore - Expertise: (history, religion, philosophy, arcane knowledge,
    etc.)

    -   Mastery: – you can cast Sorceries from Grimoires and can use any
        magic item, regardless of restriction; your Sorcery Depletion is
        1 and your Renown is halved for the purposes of determining
        Sorcery effects such as damage and range.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Sleight of hand - Expertise: (pickpocketing, legerdemain,
    misdirection, playing musical instruments, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Pack Rat – you can retrieve any item in any Item Slot
        as if it were a handy slot.

-   Speechcraft - Expertise: (bartering, haggling, deceiving,
    persuading, intimidating, performing, etc.)

    -   Mastery: – all Reaction Rolls for NPCs interacting with you are
        rolled with 3D6.

-   Stealth - Expertise: (hiding, moving silently and unseen, blending
    in with a crowd, masking your presence, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Assassin – you roll three damage dice when making a
        sneak attack.

-   Survival - Expertise: (tracking, navigating, foraging and hunting,
    animal handling, etc.)

    -   Mastery: Beast Master – you gain an animal companion. It takes
        its own actions during Initiative Turns, though it obeys all
        your commands. All Checks made by your animal companion are
        resolved using your skill. It has HP and SPD equal to your
        skill, a damage die of D6, and can perform sneak attacks. It
        also receives the benefits of any of your proficiencies, if
        applicable. If your animal companion dies, you gain a new one at
        the start of the next Downtime Turn.

**Jettons** - You have a stack of Jettons (best represented by poker
chips), which you can use in two ways.

You can spend Jettons to reduce the DV of Checks (including Saving
Throws) related to your proficiencies; each jetton reduces the DV of the
Check by 1.

You can spend Jettons to make a wager. When you make a wager, make a
claim relating to one of your proficiencies, such as “I can climb that
sheer cliff”; “I know how to disarm this trap”; “I’ve packed just the
thing we need”; “I’ve already stolen their weapon”; or “I bribed that
guard yesterday”.

You can make any claim so long as it at least flirts with the realm of
possibility, though one with mastery in their Proficiency may make even
more outlandish claims.

Roll a D10, with your chance to succeed being the number of Jettons you
spent (e.g. if you spent 5 Jettons, you would have a 5-in-10 chance of
success).

If you succeed on the roll, your claim is true; if you fail, you suffer
the consequences decided upon by the Guide, which will usually take the
form of a counterclaim.

When you make a wager, you may ask the Guide for a devil’s bargain: they
will also roll a D10, though they will keep the result hidden from you.
When you roll for your wager, you may choose to take either the die you
rolled or the die the Guide rolled to determine if you are successful.

If you choose the die the Guide rolled and are successful, you regain a
number of Jettons equal to the difference between your roll and the
Guide’s. However, if you choose the Guide’s die and fail, the
consequences will be far worse.

You regain all your Jettons at the start of a Downtime Turn.

**Damage Die** - D4

**Sorcery** - You can cast Sorceries. You begin play with the four
Grimoires in your possession, whose Sorceries you have already learned.

A Sorcery may be cast by directly reading it from a Grimoire, once per
day. Doing so takes two actions during an Initiative Turn.

Each day, if you have had a night’s Rest, you may also prepare a certain
number of Sorceries, which allows you to cast them without referencing a
Grimoire. Casting a prepared Sorcery takes one action during an
Initiative Turn. You may prepare the same Sorcery multiple times.

If a Sorcery has an ongoing effect, its duration is determined by your
Sorcery Depletion.

When you cast a prepared Sorcery, you may make a mind Check with a DV
equal to your stabilise value plus your Encumbrance. If you succeed, you
may safely cast that Sorcery again.

If you fail, that prepared Sorcery has become unstable, and casting it
again risks miscasting.

To avoid miscasting, you must succeed on a mind Check with a DV equal to
D20+the number of times that Sorcery has been cast since becoming
unstable.

**Maleficence** - You can invoke maleficence. Any number of prepared
Sorceries can be made unstable in order to deal damage to all within an
area, with a Saving Throw allowed for half damage.

The range and area of effect of your maleficence is the same as that of
a Sorcery.

Your maleficence deals 2D6 damage for the first prepared Sorcery made
unstable, plus an additional D6 damage for each additional prepared
Sorcery that is made unstable. When you reach Renown 3, and every third
time your Renown increases thereafter, the damage of your maleficence
increases.

Your maleficence is unique and the manner in which it deals damage
should be defined by a one word descriptor (e.g. lightning, fire,
necrosis). The Guide may consider the circumstantial bonuses of your
maleficence and apply bonuses and penalties as they see fit, including
enhancing or impairing the damage.

**Retort** - When an enemy casts a Sorcery or some other magical effect,
you may use a retort to cast a prepared Sorcery in response; a prepared
Sorcery cast this way is automatically made unstable.

You can use one retort per Initiative Turn.

When you reach Renown 3, and every third time your Renown increases
thereafter, the amount of retorts you can use in an Initiative Turn
increases.

entire body is covered from the peak of their steeply arched hood, to
their bandage-wrapped hands, to hem of their floor-length robe. Even
their face is covered by a paper talisman. In one hand they carry a long
gnarled staff, in the other they've raised a small bowl to chest height.

**Damage Die** - D6

**Covenant** - You pledge yourself to a Covenant, which grants you
blessings and the power to perform Miracles; these abilities are
described in greater detail in the Covenants & Miracles chapter on p.
108.

**Favour** - Your standing with your Covenant is represented by your
Favour, which you can spend to power your Relics and empower your
Miracles.

Any spent Favour is regained at the start of a Downtime Turn.

The amount of Favour you have increases with your Renown, and can be
further increased by performing actions that please your Covenant.

**Relics** - You can attune to Relics, mystical tools consecrated in the
name of your Covenant. At Renown 1, you may attune to one Relic.

When you reach Renown 3, and every third time your Renown increases
thereafter, the number of Relics you can attune to increases by 1.

Any item can be consecrated as a Relic, provided it meets the following
requirements: a blade must have at least an edge or a sharpened point,
and a wand must have neither; a talisman must offer some form of
protection and a chalice must be able to hold liquid.

It costs 200 pennies and takes one Travel Turn to consecrate an item as
a Relic. You may un-attune from a Relic, but doing so requires it be
consecrated again to re-attune.

Each Relic also grants a special ability.

-   Blade - when you deal damage, you can spend Favour to inflict a
    Status on your opponent. This Status is chosen when the Errant
    attunes to the Relic. The Status lasts for a number of Initiative
    Turns equal to Favour spent.
-   Wand – when a character makes a Check, you can spend Favour to
    reduce the DV of that Check by an amount equal to Favour spent.
-   Talisman – when you or an ally takes damage, you can spend Favour to
    impair that damage a number of steps equal to the Favour spent.
-   Chalice - you can spend Favour to grant a number of allies, equal to
    the amount of Favour spent, immunity to a Status. This immunity
    lasts for a number of Exploration Turns equal to your Renown.
