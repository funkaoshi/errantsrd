# Core Quick Reference

Check = D20 \> DV and \< Attribute.

Saving Throw DV = Threat/Renown.

-   Phys - power, toughness, and endurance.
-   Skill - quickness, precision, and perception.
-   Mind - knowledge, focus, and reason.
-   Pres - charm, confidence, and willpower.

Position determines the outcome of failure. The default Position is
risky.

-   Shaky - not as bad as it could have been.
-   Risky - about what you expected.
-   Dire - worse than you even imagined.

Impact determines the outcome of success. The default Impact is fair.

-   Strong - this went better than expected.
-   Fair - you got what you wanted.
-   Weak - not exactly what you hoped.

## Check Procedure

1.  Errant describes action with potential for meaningful failure.
2.  Guide sets Attribute for Check.
3.  Guide sets DV for Check.

-   -   If DV \< 0, Check automatically succeeds.

1.  Guide sets Position and Impact for Check.
2.  Errant rolls D20, attempting to roll \> DV and \< Attribute.
3.  Guide describes outcome of Check.

## Reaction Rolls

|       |       |     |       |       |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| DV +8 | DV +4 | \-  | DV -2 | DV -4 |

## Negotiations

Reaction Roll result = disposition.

Initial Disposition = \# of exchanges.

Banal exchanges require no Check.

Giving exchange

-   Failure or success with weak Impact: NPC is unimpressed.
-   Success: disposition +1.
-   Success with strong Impact: disposition +3.

Taking exchange

-   Failure at dire Position: disposition -3.
-   Failure: NPC refuses, disposition -1.
-   Failure at shaky Position or success with weak Impact: NPC agrees to
    a compromise.
-   Success: the NPC agrees to what you want.
-   Success with strong Impact: NPC agrees, and offers to do more than
    asked for!

Convincing exchange

-   Failure at dire Position: disposition -3.
-   Failure: disposition -1.
-   Failure at shaky Position or success with weak Impact: NPC is
    unconvinced, but not insulted.
-   Success: NPC is receptive, but requires proof.
-   Success with strong Impact: NPC accepts what you said
    wholeheartedly.

Bribe exchanges require no Checks.

# Items Quick Reference

-   Item Slots = phys.
-   1 Exhaustion = 1 Item Slot
-   1 Encumbrance per 25% of slots filled, up to 4. After 100%, each
    Item Slot = 1 Encumbrance.
-   Depletion = quantity or duration of items, Sorceries, Miracles (Burn
    = Depletion for light sources).
-   Supply restores Depletion of items. 1 Supply = ¼ Item Slot.
    Restoring Depletion takes 4 Supply per Item Slot an item takes up.
    If not restored when Depletion = 0, item removed from inventory.

## Supply Available per Downtime Turn

|            |     |     |     |       |       |       |

## Travel Turn Actions

-   Peregrinate - Pathfinder makes navigation Check to avoid getting
    lost.

    specific location, pathfinder makes navigation Check.
-   Orient - DV of next navigation Check is -4.
-   Forage - Each Errant makes navigation Check; on success, +2 Supply.
-   Make camp - Pathfinder makes navigation Check to find suitable
    campsite.
-   Take watch - 2 characters keep watch = no Exhaustion. No characters
    keep watch = Event Die rolls of 5 are rolls of 1.
-   Sleep – 2 Travel Turns sleeping = night’s Rest.

## Travel Turn Procedure

## Death & Dying

-   At 0 HP, phys Saving Throw with DV = damage taken to avoid going out
    of action.
-   Damage past 0 causes wounds.
-   On death’s door = dead in Renown \# of Initiative Turns unless
    stabilised with healer’s kit or HP brought above 0.
-   Consigned to the reaper = dead in Renown \# of Initiative Turns.

## Chases

-   Character with lowest SPD/MV on each side makes movement roll.
-   If two 4’s are rolled, that side escapes/catches quarry.
-   If character rolls doubles, that side makes Attack Rolls or other
    actions.
-   If any dice across sides match, characters make ranged Attack Rolls.
-   Sprint = double \# movement dice with successful phys Check (DV =
    Encumbrance). If fail, no movement roll.
-   Side that rolled lowest each Turn rolls for a Chase development, p.
    163.

## Fall Damage

|      |            |
|------|------------|
| 10’  | 1D6        |
| 20’  | 1D6 × 1D4  |
| 30’  | 1D6 × 1D6  |
| 40’  | 1D6 × 1D8  |
| 50’  | 1D6 × 1D10 |
| 60’  | 1D6 × 1D12 |
| 70’+ | 1D6 × 1D20 |

Burning = 1D6 damage / Initiative Turn on fire.

Hold breath \# Initiative Turns = phys - 10. After, 1D6 damage per
Initiative Turn.
