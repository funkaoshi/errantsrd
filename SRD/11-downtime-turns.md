# Downtime Turns

## Downtime Turn Actions

During a Downtime Turn, Errants specify what action they are taking in
the period of time between adventures, in addition to regular
activities.

Most activities that require progress to be tracked in some way during
Downtime Turns use the following procedure.

First, set a tracker for the number of successes an activity requires.

An Errant may use their action during Downtime Turns to attempt to make
progress on this activity. Note that they must describe an adequate
method of accomplishing this activity. If the Errant does not have the
necessary resources required to engage in such an activity, whether it
be money or some other such resource (for example, if attempting to set
up a drug trade, they would need prior access to a reliable source of
drugs), they cannot attempt the action.

When an Errant attempts to make progress on an activity during Downtime
Turns, they roll 2D6, plus any appropriate situational modifiers,
whether they be positive (expenditure of extra resources, clever method
or approach, character skill) or negative (unreliable resources or
otherwise poor fictional positioning). Situational modifiers should not
exceed in total +/-3.

-   A roll of 10+ means that the Errant is successful in their activity,
    and may mark one success on the tracker.
-   A roll of 7-9 indicates that either a complication or setback has
    occurred, which must be dealt with before further progress can be
    made, or that partial progress has been made; in the case of partial
    progress, a success is not marked on the tracker, but the next time
    the Errant attempts this activity, it will automatically succeed.
-   A roll of 6 or lower indicates that the Errant was unsuccessful in
    their endeavour, and no progress is made.

Graphic: A strange bipedal creature, both of its legs muscular and
similar to a human's, with a tail protruding from its back. Its abdomen
suggests a melancholic face, but perhaps that's just the creature's
peculiar bone structure. It has no visible mouth or arms. From the top
of its abdomen sprout a waving cluster of stalks, each containing a
single eye at the tip.

An Errant may choose to forgo their Downtime Turn action to assist
another Errant in their endeavours; this allows the Errant being aided
to add +1 to their roll.

Many procedures for specific actions follow, but you can use this basic
framework to accommodate anything an Errant may wish to do during
Downtime Turns, be it learning a new language, being sworn into a secret
order, changing Alignment score, engaging in spiritual struggle with a
cursed blade, etc.

Use the following as a rubric for the number of successes required on a
tracker for an activity to be successful:

-   1 – Minor Advantage
-   3 – Significant Advantage
-   5 – Campaign Defining Goal
-   7 – Major Campaign Defining Goal

An Errant may forgo their action to assist another Errant with their
Downtime Turn action. If they do, they give the Errant they are
assisting +1 to their roll, though as usual this cannot cause the bonus
to exceed +3.

## Passing Time

Many downtime activities presuppose an Errant having access to some
resources, whether they be money, an opportunity to capitalise upon, or
both. Wretched louts that they are, they will often have neither of
these, or simply lack the inclination towards applying themselves
towards decent, fruitful business.

In such cases, they may simply narrate as their Downtime Turn action how
they are passing time.

The Guide is encouraged to give a small bonus to the Errant, perhaps
pending a Check, based on the activity they describe.

For example, an Errant who spends a Downtime Turn engaging in foot races
may gain the ability to roll an extra movement die once in between
Downtime Turns; an Errant who spends their Downtime Turn studying the
signs of local wildlife may choose to treat a roll of encounter on the
Event Die as an encounter sign instead once in-between Downtime Turns,
and so on.

## Setbacks

A setback indicates that some complication has arisen which is stymieing
an Errant’s progress on their goal or renders an Errant’s asset
unusable. For example, if an Errant’s Estate is suffering a setback,
some problem is rendering it uninhabitable till dealt with.

When an Errant’s Estate, Institution, infrastructure project, or Domain
suffers a setback, they gain XP equal to its current base investment
cost (e.g. if an Errant is attempting to advance their tier 3
Institution to tier 4 and they suffer a setback, they gain XP equal to
the base investment cost of a tier 3 Institution: 2,500); if multiple
Errants are invested, they divide the XP equally amongst themselves.

A setback can be cleared by dealing with it directly in play. If a
setback is rolled at the beginning of a Downtime Turn, the Company may
choose to suspend taking their Downtime Turn actions to deal with said
setback; when they return, the Event Die should not be rolled again.

A setback may also be dealt with by spending a Downtime Turn action. It
is up to the Guide’s discretion depending on the specific nature of the
setback whether simply taking the action will suffice to deal with it,
if a Check is required, or whether expenditures of resources are
necessary; a Guide may also rule that due to the nature of the setback,
it cannot be dealt with abstractly through a Downtime Turn action and
must be handled by the Errant directly.

As a general procedure, if an Institution, infrastructure project, or
Domain suffers a setback, it can be cleared with a Downtime Turn action
and paying half the current base investment cost.

## Recovery

When a Downtime Turn begins, before the Event Die is rolled, all Company
members restore HP up to their maximum, any Archetype based resources
such as Jettons or Favour are fully restored, as well as any charges of
True Strikes and Deflects.

## Rumours

Gathering specific information involves concerted effort, listening in
the right places, and asking the right people. However, in the course of
spending time in any Settlement, the natural dross that drips from
wagging tongues will be overheard. Though such knowledge is likely
nonsense and best disregarded, it may contain a kernel of truth;
regardless, such rumours provide excitable Errants with leads to follow
for questing and adventure.

At the start of a Downtime Turn, the Company hears a rumour.

## Shopping & Socialising

During a Downtime Turn, an Errant is free to make any purchases of
generally available items, as well as make any minor social calls that
they wish without spending their action.

Purchases more involved, such as hunting down a specialty item, or
interactions more intensive, such as attempting to advance one's
relationship or gather information, will generally take an action.

Graphic: An elderly woman displays a variety of wares on a table and a
hand cart. She wears patched but tidy clothing, a head scarf, and a kind
smile. Her goods include a sword, stoppered potion bottles, jewelry
hanging across the top of the hand cart's canopy, a dagger, a small
chest, rings laid out, and a mirror. There is a cat sitting on the
counter. A note on the cart reads “cat not for sale”.

## Hiring Retainers 

The number of Retainers available each Downtime Turn is determined by
Settlement Type.

-   A hamlet has D4 hirelings and D4 specialists available each Downtime
    Turn.
-   A village has D6 hirelings and D6 specialists available.
-   A town has D8 hirelings, D8 specialists, and D8 × 10 mercenaries
    available, of whom 10% will be lieutenants and 5% will be captains.
-   A city has D10 hirelings, D10 specialists, and D10 × 10 mercenaries
    available, of whom 10% will be lieutenants and 5% will be captains.
-   A metropolis will have D12 hirelings, D12 specialists, and D12 × 10
    mercenaries available, of whom 10% will be lieutenants and 5% will
    be captains.

An Errant can choose to spend money advertising for available positions
during a Downtime Turn. For each 100p spent, add +1 to a roll for a
given Retainer type, or attract one interested henchman, up to the
maximum for the Settlement’s die size used to determine Retainer
availability (e.g. in a village an Errant could spend up to 600p
advertising for a bonus of +6). Advertising for Retainers does not use
up an Errant’s action for their Downtime Turn. The types of Retainers
available are determined by their Rarity.

The Renown of interested henchmen is determined by Settlement Type.

-   Henchmen in hamlets are always Renown 1.
-   Henchmen in villages are Renown D2
-   Henchmen in towns are Renown D3
-   Henchmen in cities are Renown D4
-   Henchmen in metropolises are Renown D5

Unlike other Retainers, henchmen do not automatically accept an offer of
employment. Instead, the Errants must engage in a Negotiation with the
henchmen, offering them a share of the treasure (a half share is
considered the standard amount). A botched Negotiation may lead to that
henchman bad-mouthing the Errants to other potential recruits.

To determine the Archetype of a henchman, roll below.

|      |              |
|------|--------------|
| 1-5  | Warrior      |
| 6-8  | Professional |
| 9-10 | Magic user   |

Retainer Morale is determined by the pres of the employer, as well as a
variable modifier determined by rolling 2D6. For each 25% increase in
salary offered or equivalent bonus or benefit, add +1 to the 2D6 roll,
up to max of +3.

|       |        |      |          |
|-------|--------|------|----------|
| Pres  | Morale | 2D6  | Modifier |
| 3-4   | 5      | 2    | -2       |
| 5-8   | 6      | 3-5  | -1       |
| 9-13  | 7      | 6-8  | 0        |
| 14-16 | 8      | 9-11 | 1        |
| 17-18 | 9      | 12   | 2        |
| 19-20 | 10     | \-   | \-       |

Graphic: The scene of a bustling tavern lit by paper lanterns. A
shirtless man wearing a helmet flexes his arms impressively. A woman
wearing a patterned dress with her hair in a long braid smiles and
squeezes one of the man’s biceps. Elsewhere in the tavern patrons sit
and drink, one man drowning his sorrows in his cup while his companion
reassures him with a hand on his shoulder. A thief moves through the
crowd, her head completely shaved, and she nimbly plucks the sorrowful
man’s purse from his belt.

Graphic: A funeral occurs in the rain. Four Errants have just finished
burying their friend. One holds a long stiletto blade in one hand, a
full pack of supplies in the other. They look back towards the gloomy
woods in the distance. One of of the company is a spellcaster, looking
over the grave and casting a bright spell with her hands. One of them is
a smaller figure, holding their cloak above their head to block the
rain, a hand crossbow held loosely in their other hand. The last figure
leans against a shovel stuck in the ground, one foot propped up on it.
Their features are hidden by a long ragged cloak.

## Funerals

Death is inevitable, and therefore provides the perfect excuse for the
throwing of parties.

During a Downtime Turn, Errants are able to throw a funeral for their
fallen comrades, provided that a body is available to bury. This does
not take an action.

For every 1p an Errant spends commemorating a fallen comrade’s life,
whether that be through funding their funeral service, erecting statues
of the deceased, commissioning poems or artworks in their honour, or
otherwise, they can ‘purchase’ 1 XP from the dearly departed.

## Conspicuous Consumption

Errants as a rule are not known for their keen financial acumen, else
they would not be Errants. As such, whenever they come into possession
of any sum of money, they are just as quickly rid of it.

After they have taken their action for a Downtime Turn, an Errant can
choose to engage in Conspicuous Consumption.

There are four types of Conspicuous Consumption that an Errant may
partake in:

-   Carousing (phys) - partying, substance abuse, orgies, and
    rodomontade
-   Frippery (skill) - haute adornments and fashions, sumptuous
    epicureanism and gourmandizing, fads and trends
-   Obscurantism (mind) - sophistry, obsessive and trivial research,
    supreme pretension
-   Do-goodery (pres) - needless philanthropy, moral pomposity and
    outrage, doomed, futile, or otherwise ineffectual causes

An Errant describes how they are engaging in Conspicuous Consumption,
and then rolls a die, which is multiplied by a set amount, to see how
much money they waste in that endeavour (and consequently, how much XP
they gain).

An Errant can invoke a relevant Institution to increase their roll
amount by the Institution's tier (e.g. if an Errant is gambling, and
they or a Company member own a tier 3 gambling house, they may elect to
gain a +3 bonus to their Conspicuous Consumption roll).

The die size and multiplier is determined by the Settlement Type

-   Hamlet – D4 × 200
-   Village – D6 × 400
-   Town – D8 × 600
-   Cities – D10 × 800
-   Metropolis – D12 × 1,000

If the result of their roll indicates that an Errant spends more money
than they currently possess, they are indebted to a creditor for the
surplus, and must make a Saving Throw based on the type of Conspicuous
Consumption engaged in, with a DV equal to the result of the die roll.
If they fail the Saving Throw, roll on the table below to see what
happens.

1.  Something gets burned down or destroyed; roll a D6 to see how bad it
    was: on a 1, confined to a single building; on a 6, a big part of
    town has gone up. Future Conspicuous Consumption rolls receive a
    penalty equal to the D6 roll till it’s repaired. Roll another D6 to
    see who knows: on a 4 or lower, just the Company knows; on a 5, a
    blackmailer knows; on a 6, EVERYBODY knows.
2.  Beaten and robbed: lose half HP and all items in inventory.
3.  Magical affliction: someone or something has put a curse on you, or
    transformed you into an animal.
4.  You’ve gotten into legal trouble. You’re due to appear in court.
    Roll a D6 to see how bad the charges are.
5.  You’ve contracted a disease or infection.
6.  You’ve made an enemy; a random NPC now hates you. Roll a D6 to see
    how bad it is: on a 1, they can’t stand your presence, on a 6,
    they’re after your head.
7.  You’ve insulted a local person or organisation of import. Lose D4
    Faction reputation.
8.  You wake up in a random adjacent hex, stark naked, in someone or
    something’s house/lair. Your friends have all your stuff. Roll a
    Reaction Roll for your host.
9.  You get into a brawl. Lose D6 HP.
10. You’ve got a hangover. All Checks for the next two Travel Turns have
    DV +2.
11. You’ve made a pact with a god, devil, or some other supernatural
    power, and have to do some quest or task for them.
12. You’re betrothed. Calling off the marriage will incur the wrath of
    the family or your scorned lover. If you’re already married, this
    could get messy.
13. You’ve earned notoriety as a gadabout. Your next Conspicuous
    Consumption roll will be doubled.
14. You’ve gotten a new tattoo or some other bodily alteration. Roll a
    D6 to see how bad it is: on a 1, it’s offensive to EVERYONE (-2 to
    all Reaction Rolls while it’s visible); on a 6, it's actually pretty
    cool.
15. You’ve made an ass of yourself in town. No one will take you
    seriously for the next D4 Downtime Turns.
16. You’ve been initiated into a cult, secret society, or some other
    organisation.
17. You’ve impressed someone, made an ally, or attracted a new Retainer.
18. You get a windfall. Receive half money spent on Conspicuous
    Consumption back.
19. You make a discovery or hear a rumour of some sort.
20. You make an advancement. Increase rolled Attribute by 1.

## Debts

Given that Errants have one of the shortest expected lifespans in the
natural world, no creditor will guarantee a debt to any individual
Errant. Instead, the debt of the entire Company is held cumulatively.

At the start of every Downtime Turn, the remaining amount owed by the
Company doubles.

Creditors are nasty, unscrupulous sorts, and there are sure to be
ramifications for failing to honour one's debts. While the Company owes
a debt, no Errants may engage in Conspicuous Consumption.

If there is no obvious figure in a Settlement who would loan money to
the Company, the table below may be used as inspiration.

|               |              |
|---------------|--------------|
| unctuous      | eunuch       |
| sententious   | merchant     |
| truculent     | clergyman    |
| supercilious  | madam        |
| fulsome       | officer      |
| vainglorious  | intellectual |

Graphic: A muscular man from the torso up, holding a large mallet you’d
use to strike a gong behind his back, ready to swing it.

## Lifestyle

Errants are a universally hedonistic lot, and will live as sumptuous a
lifestyle as possible within their means, and often beyond it, without
exception.

Rather than account for every expenditure and income an Errant accrues
during downtime, a simplified method is used to avoid such tedious
book-keeping.

When a Downtime Turn ends, whatever remaining money an Errant has is
halved to pay for lifestyle expenses. If the Company is taking multiple
Downtime Turns in a row, they only pay for lifestyle expenses on the
last Downtime Turn they take.

This sum may seem large, but it represents Errants living at the very
edge of their means, as well as all other expenditures such as taxes or
managing any Institutions, Estates, or Domains that they may have.

If an Errant has an accountant employed, they only pay a quarter of
their current liquid wealth for lifestyle expenditures.

## Trades

On rare occasion, an Errant will act against their baser nature and
apply themselves towards practical education for a vocation, such as
smithing, fletching, or cooking.

An Errant begins as a layman in any given Trade.

To attempt to learn a Trade, an Errant pays the requisite fee and rolls
2D6 plus any applicable bonuses for extra expenditures (each extra 25%
of the learning cost adds +1) or situational bonuses, to a maximum of
+3. Each attempt takes a Downtime Turn.

|     |                                                          |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Training attempt is successful.                          |
| 7-9 | Treat the next training attempt as an automatic success. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                     |

To become an apprentice in a given Trade, an Errant must find a trainer
who is of apprentice level or higher in their chosen Trade. Acquiring
certification as an apprentice in a Trade requires one successful
training attempt. Training to become an apprentice costs 2,000p per
training attempt. An Errant who is certified as an apprentice may make
crafting rolls for items related to their Trade. Any items produced are
of shoddy Quality.

To become a journeyman in a given Trade, they must find a trainer who is
of journeyman level or higher in their chosen Trade. Acquiring
certification as a journeyman in a Trade requires two successful
training attempts. Training to become a journeyman costs 4,000p per
training attempt. An Errant who is certified as a journeyman may make
crafting rolls for items related to their Trade with +1 to their roll.
Any items produced are of average Quality.

To become a master in a given Trade, they must find a trainer who is of
master level or higher in their chosen Trade. Acquiring certification as
a master in a Trade requires three successful training attempts.
Training to become a master costs 8,000p per training attempt. An Errant
who is certified as a master may make crafting rolls for items related
to their Trade with +2 to their roll. Any items produced are of Quality.

To become a legendary artisan in a given Trade, they must find a
legendary artisan who is willing to pass their mantle on. The Errant
will be tasked with completing three significant quests, each to recover
a specific item component, which they will craft into a Wondrous Item.

Once this has been done, the Errant receives the title of legendary
artisan. They make crafting rolls at +3, and are capable of crafting
further Wondrous Items.

Graphic: A woman works steadily in her forge. She wears an apron and
headband, every muscle of her body bulging and huge. She grips a hammer
in one hand, swinging down on the blade of a sword which she holds in
place with tongs. Behind her is a bellows and oven, the light of it so
bright that the fire cannot even be seen.

## Improving Attributes

Directed training, under the supervised tutelage of a trainer, can
confer permanent bonuses to an Errant’s capabilities. If there is a
suitable trainer in the Settlement where the Errant is taking a Downtime
Turn, and they have agreed to train the Errant, they may attempt to
improve one of their Attributes.

To improve an Attribute, 5D4 are rolled and the lowest die result is
dropped from the total. If the total is higher than the current
Attribute being trained, it improves by 1.

An Attribute cannot be trained higher than the trainer’s Attribute (e.g.
if the trainer had a skill of 15, an Errant training under them could
only improve their skill up to 15).

The first attempt to improve an Attribute costs 1,000 pennies. Every
additional training attempt doubles the cost; so 2,000, then 4,000, then
8,000, and so on. This amount is cumulative across all Attributes (e.g.
if an Errant’s first attempt at training was to improve their skill,
they would pay 1,000p; if during the next Downtime Turn they attempted
to improve their phys, they would pay 2,000p).

## Talents

Certain people in the world know special techniques and abilities, known
as Talents, which can be taught. These people are rare, and often tied
to particular Factions or special individuals, who will agree to teach
them only to those who have the highest reputation or bond with them.

To attempt to learn a Talent, an Errant rolls 2D6 plus any applicable
bonuses the Guide deems appropriate (if an Errant’s Archetype is
relevant to the Talent being learned, they may add their Renown divided
by three to the roll), to a maximum of +3. Each attempt takes a Downtime
Turn.

|     |                                                          |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Training attempt is successful.                          |
| 7-9 | Treat the next training attempt as an automatic success. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                     |

A Talent requires three successes to learn. An Errant who fails a total
of three times while attempting to learn a Talent is refused further
training by their trainer.

### Example Talents

**Wrath of the Boar** - when you reach 0 HP the first time between
Downtime Turns, instead go to 1 HP. You cannot be reduced below 1 HP for
the rest of combat. When combat ends, you immediately take all the
damage that would have been dealt to you after this Talent activated.

**Always Prepared** - if you are in a Settlement of some kind, you may
set aside any number of Item Slots and money as your load out. These
Item Slots count for Encumbrance as normal. At any point, you may
retrieve any mundane item from your load out, so long as you have
sufficient Item Slots set aside and money set aside to carry and pay for
that item. That item then fills those Item Slots and its price is
deducted from the money set aside. You may retrieve items until you have
filled all your set aside Item Slots and/or money.

**Blood Magic** - before casting a Sorcery or Miracle, you may perform
blood magic, lowering your phys or skill to empower your magic. For each
Attribute point lowered, you may choose from among the following:

-   Increase your Miracle roll by 1.
-   Treat your Renown as 1 higher for the purpose of Sorcery effects.
-   Increase your Miracle or Sorcery Depletion by 1.
-   Lower your stabilise value by 1.

shoulder. Electric power arcs between the apprentice's hands, and they
look down at the effect they're producing with a determined expression.
Both wear conical hats, but the older wizard's is much more impressive.

## Animals

Animals can be sorted into three categories.

Graphic: The head of a ram, its eyes open wide, its long horns curving
upwards.

-   Feral - wild members of domestic animal species. Training attempts
    cost 250p each.
-   Wild - non-domesticated animal species. Training attempts cost 500p
    each.
-   Exotic - monstrous or supernatural animal species. Training attempts
    cost 1,000p each.

Training an animal takes a Downtime Turn. To attempt to train an animal,
the Errant rolls 2D6 plus any applicable bonuses the Guide applies
depending on their method, to a maximum of +3. Expertise in survival
adds +2 to the roll, while mastery adds +3. Improper training methods
may penalise the roll, to a maximum of -3.

|     |                                                          |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Training attempt is successful.                          |
| 7-9 | Treat the next training attempt as an automatic success. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                     |

An untamed animal must first be tamed before it can be taught any
commands. Taming a feral animal takes one successful training attempt, a
wild animal takes two, and an exotic animal takes three. If an Errant
fails a total of three times while attempting to tame an animal, it
cannot be tamed.

Once an animal has been tamed, determine an animal's Morale as you would
a Retainer's; an Errant of The Deviant Archetype with Proficiency in
survival may base Morale determination off of their skill rather than
their pres.

Tamed animals will obey basic commands, and if they have any special
actions according to their species, can perform those.

If an animal has attack options it can perform, treat it as a henchman
for the purposes of Retainer limits.

An animal can be taught to obey specific commands or new actions and
abilities. To do so the Errant describes what they wish to teach the
animal, and the Guide will set an appropriate tracker for the number of
successes. If an Errant fails a total of three times while attempting to
teach an animal a new command, it cannot learn that command.

## Tinkering

Any Errant can use their action during a Downtime Turn to attempt to
customise or personalise items. To do so, they pay half the cost of the
item for materials, and roll 2D6. Specific customizations may require
the Errant to have found specific materials during play. Bonuses for
being trained in a relevant Trade or for extra expenditures may apply.

When Tinkering, the Errant chooses which category their stated
modifications fall under.

-   Durable - the item is made stronger or more resistant to damage.
-   Sophisticated - the item is made more aesthetically pleasing, more
    complex, or gains additional functions.
-   Efficient - the item is made quicker to use, deploy, or recover.
-   Potent - the item is made stronger or more effective at its primary
    function.

However, customising an item this way causes the item to also receive an
attendant drawback.

|     |                                               |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Errant chooses the drawback.                  |
| 7-9 | Guide chooses the drawback.                   |
| 2-6 | Item receives a drawback but no modification. |

The drawback cannot be the inverse of the modification (e.g. an item
modified to be durable cannot be frail).

-   Frail - the item becomes more delicate, fragile, or high
    maintenance.
-   Crude - the item becomes less aesthetically pleasing, simpler, or
    worse at tasks that aren't its primary function.
-   Unwieldy - the item becomes cumbersome, slow, or laborious to use.
-   Ineffective - the item becomes weaker or less effective at its
    primary function.

## Crafting

Graphic: A bladder, like a whoopie cushion or a deflated balloon. An eye
peers out from its body.

An Errant who is at least an apprentice in a given Trade can make items
related to their Trade.

To do so, they initially pay half the price of the item they are
attempting to craft, representing the cost of materials, hired help, and
so on.

They then roll 2D6, plus any bonuses from their Trade. Each attempt
takes a downtime action.

|     |                                                      |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Crafting attempt is successful.                      |
| 7-9 | Treat next crafting attempt as an automatic success. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                 |

For each 2,000p of the base cost of the item, one success is needed when
crafting (e.g. plate armour, costing 4,000p, would require two
successes).

## Alchemy

During a Downtime Turn, as an action, an Errant can attempt to turn an
alchemist's kit and all the alchemical components within it into an
alchemical item.

Doing so requires an Alchemy Check which is a skill Check. Each
alchemical component within the alchemist's kit increases the DV of the
Check by 1.

An alchemical item can be created in a variety of media, such as:

-   Incense - inhalable. DV+2 to create.
-   Oil - topical. Can be used to coat a weapon (lasts for 10 Attack
    Rolls) or a quiver of ammunition.
-   Pill - ingestible. Does not take up any Item Slots. DV+4 to create.
-   Potion - ingestible.
-   Powder - ingestible (water soluble) or inhalable (if blown; fills an
    area five feet square, dissipates in one Initiative Turn).
-   Wafer - ingestible. Consuming counts as eating a ration. DV+1 to
    create.

A created alchemical item takes up ¼ of an Item Slot per alchemical
component used to create it. It has a Depletion of 1.

Each alchemical component used to create an alchemical item contributes
its effect to that item. For example, the nails of a ghoul have a
paralysing effect. The gills of an ambrosia mushroom have a healing
effect. An alchemical item made with both alchemical components would
have a paralysing and healing effect.

If an effect would deal damage, it deals D4 damage; if an effect would
heal, it heals D4 HP; if the effect would require a Saving Throw to
avoid, the DV for the Saving Throw is 2; if the effect is ongoing, the
Depletion for its duration is 1.

For each additional alchemical component beyond the first in an
alchemical item that contributes the same effect, increase the damage or
healing by 1 die step, the DV of a Saving Throw by 2, and the Depletion
by 1.

Philosophers can be hired to make alchemical items in lieu of an Errant.
A philosopher has a skill of 14 for the purposes of Alchemy Checks.
Additional philosophers hired to aid in the creation of alchemical items
reduce the DV of Alchemy Checks by 2 per additional philosopher.

hammer and tongs above a horseshoe.

## Wondrous Items

A Wondrous Item is a unique piece of craftsmanship, specifically
commissioned for its bearer, forged from remarkable materials, and
wrought by the hand of a legendary artisan. They count as masterwork
Quality in addition to their other effects.

To commission a Wondrous Item, a legendary artisan must be found and
convinced to accept a commission. Doing so is an adventure in and of
itself.

Next, remarkable materials must be furnished. These are rare items with
history behind them, whether it be the scales of a great wyrm, or the
wood of an ancient tree struck by lightning. one to three remarkable
materials can be given to a legendary artisan to construct a Wondrous
Item.

The base cost of a Wondrous Item is four times that of a masterwork item
of the same type (e.g. a suit of plate mail would cost 32,000p). The
legendary artisan must be paid this amount as a commission fee.

After these steps have been taken, the Wondrous Item will be ready after
one to three Downtime Turns, depending on how many remarkable materials
were used in its creation.

Once the Wondrous Item has been received, its bearer must name and
describe the item.

Wondrous Items confer benefits to the wielder, though not fully at the
level of a true magical item. Treat it as though the item had received
one to three Tinkering modifications (depending on the amount of
remarkable materials furnished), but with no drawbacks.

If an Errant has reached the level of legendary artisan themselves, they
may craft Wondrous Items of their own accord; they must still find
remarkable materials to craft it with. Otherwise, it follows the same
procedure for crafting regular items.

A Wondrous Item, though not magical, contains the spark of magic within
it. It counts as magical for the purposes of damage resistances, and may
in time become a magic item or Grimoire.

## Magic Items

When a Wondrous Item is used in the enacting of some great deed, whether
it be the slaying of a great beast, a daring heist, or a contest of
skill & wit, its magic is kindled. The Guide has the final say on
whether an event is worthy of kindling the magic of a Wondrous Item.

When such magic is kindled, the Errant and the Guide may both propose
what the magic of such an item is. The magical effects are influenced by
the remarkable materials used to craft the item, the personality and
intentions of both the legendary artisan and the wielder of the item, as
well as, most significantly, the deed that kindled its magic.

As a general Guideline:

-   If the item is a weapon or piece of armour, it receives True Strikes
    or Deflects equal to the number of remarkable materials used to
    craft it.
-   The magic item receives a number of powers equal to the number of
    remarkable materials used to craft it.
-   The magic item receives between one to three additional powers based
    on the greatness of the deed that kindled its magic.

## Clearing Pacts

In lieu of completing a pact directly during normal play, an Errant can
spend their Downtime Turn action attempting to resolve the pact.

Resolving a pact requires a pres Check, with a DV of 2 per doctrinal
level of the Miracle that caused the pact to be formed (e.g. a pact
resulting from a third doctrine Miracle would have a DV of 6).

The Guide may lower the DV for the Check depending on the resources or
method of the Errant.

Graphic: A demonic figure kneeling close to the ground, its skin
leathery and batlike, with wings extended behind it, sticking out a long
forked tongue that comes down to its abdomen.

## Solving Grimoires

If an adequate solution to a Grimoire's learning condition cannot be
found during normal play, an Errant can spend their Downtime Turn action
attempting to solve the Grimoire.

To do so, they make a mind Check with a DV of 8 minus their Renown. If
they are successful, they have solved the Grimoire and learned the
Sorcery within; on a failure, the DV for attempting to solve the
Grimoire increases by 1.

The Guide may lower the DV for the Check depending on the resources or
method of the Errant.

Graphic: A woman stares in amazement at an obsidian pyramaid in her
palm. A dozen tiny needles are erupting out of the hand from beneath her
skin. She has a third eye, vertical-lidded with a cross shaped pupil,
opening on her forehead. Her right eye is also strange. The socket has
reformed into a large circle, and the surrounding skin puffy and veined.

## Creating New Sorceries & Grimoires

As a Downtime Turn action, an Errant who has the ability to cast
Sorceries can change the nature of the Sorceries stored within their
Grimoires.

To do so, they select two Grimoires in their possession. They may then
swap the essence and sphere between the selected Grimoires, and devise a
new Sorcery to be contained within each Grimoire.

A Wondrous Item made with at least two remarkable materials can be
turned into a Grimoire. In this case, the Errant may choose among any of
the essences and spheres contained within Grimoires of their possession,
and apply them to the newly created Grimoire; this does not affect the
existing Grimoires in any way. Doing so still takes a Downtime Turn
action.

## Rituals

Graphic: Looming behind the text on this page is the shadow of a robed
figure raising a knife to strike. Blood spatters the bottom of the page.

Rituals encompass everything from brewing homunculi in vats to setting a
magical ward on one's domicile to cursing a region with pestilence.

A Ritual must be performed by an Errant with the ability to either cast
Sorceries or perform Miracles.

To begin a Ritual, Grimoires must be offered, which will be consumed and
destroyed. Favour may also be offered, which will be removed permanently
from the Errant who offered them.

The Errant defines the nature of the Ritual: its effects, location, and
duration. The parameters of the Ritual are defined by the Grimoires and
Favour offered. Its effect can incorporate any of the essences, spheres,
or themes of any of the Grimoires offered to perform the Ritual. For
each Favour offered, it can also incorporate one interpretation of an
eminence of the Covenant to which the Errant who offered Favour belongs.

Based on the effect, location, and duration of the Ritual described, the
Guide sets a tracker for how many successes will be required for the
Ritual to be completed.

To attempt to enact the Ritual, an Errant spends their action during a
Downtime Turn and rolls 2D6. They may add their Renown divided by three
to the roll if they are of The Zealot or The Occult Archetypes.

|     |                                                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Ritual attempt is successful.                                                                   |
| 7-9 | The Ritual requires some new offering, or the completion of a task, before it can be continued. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                                                            |

If an Errant fails a total of three times while attempting to enact a
Ritual, it fails.

## Alignment

Alignment does not describe personality, psychology, or behaviour. It
has nothing to do with morality as such.

Law and Chaos are metaphysical forces in the multiverse, endlessly in
conflict. One’s Alignment represents which side of this conflict you
have chosen. This is a metaphysical choice, and changes the very nature
of your soul.

Law is order, structure, civilization, sacrifice, and the collective.
Chaos is disorder, entropy, possibility, self-interest, and the
individual. Neutrality is either to understand the Balance necessary
between Law and Chaos, or to have no stake in the conflict.

Your Alignment is represented by a position along this continuum

L3 – L2 – L1 – N – C1 – C2 – C3

L3 being the extremity of Lawful and C3 being the extremity of Chaos.
Errants start the game at Alignment N, except for Errants of The Zealot
Archetype, who may start at Alignment L1 or C1, depending on the
Alignment of their Covenant.

Your actions can shift your Alignment score, depending on the Guide’s
ruling. Note that the closer a character gets to either extreme of the
Alignment scale, the more significant an action must be to change their
Alignment further towards Law or Chaos.

If your Alignment is C1 or higher, your soul registers as Chaotic for
the purposes of magical effects. You can speak the language of Chaos,
and the Reaction Rolls of all Chaotic characters increase by 1 for each
point of Chaotic Alignment; Reaction Rolls of all Lawful characters
decrease by 1 for each point of Chaotic Alignment.

If your Alignment is L1 or higher, your soul registers as Lawful for the
purposes of magical effects. You can speak the language of Law, and the
Reaction Rolls of all Lawful characters increase by 1 for each point of
Lawful Alignment; Reaction Rolls of all Chaotic characters decrease by 1
for each point of Lawful Alignment.

Only one Company member’s Alignment can affect a Reaction Roll; modify
the Reaction Roll by the Alignment of the most extremely aligned
character. In the case of ties, modify the Reaction Roll by the
Alignment that would Impact the Reaction Roll most negatively.

Certain Factions will require you to be of a certain Alignment to ally
with them or to increase your reputation with them past a certain point.

If a Zealot is no longer in Alignment with their Covenant, they cannot
perform Miracles until they realign themselves with their Covenant.

Characters of extreme Alignment either way may be contacted by or truck
with the forces of Law or Chaos. Characters of Alignment L3 or C3 may be
appointed as champions of Law or Chaos.

## Legal Trials

Graphic: A crouching fellow who either has no arms, or is wearing a
tube-like tunic from which only his legs and face protrude.

In the case that legal disputes are resolved via trial before a judge,
jury, or similar, rather than some other method such as by combat or
ordeal, the following procedure may be used.

When a case is brought before the Company, make a Reaction Roll (or, if
the offended party is a Faction the Company has a reputation with, the
reputation is used), modified based on available evidence, severity of
the crime, bribes made to the court, jurists employed and so on. The sum
total of these modifiers should not exceed +/-3.

From this point, run the legal trial as a Negotiation.

If an Errant wishes to bring a legal case to bear on someone else, they
may do so as an action during a Downtime Turn. To do so, they roll 2D6
plus the number of jurists employed, and any other relevant modifiers,
though not exceeding +/-3 in total.

|     |                                                                                                                                            |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Case is successful.                                                                                                                        |
| 7-9 | Further evidence or action, or some other form of direct intervention by the Errant, is necessary before the case can proceed any further. |
| 2-6 | Case fails.                                                                                                                                |

## Investigations

The long-term gathering of information, whether that be researching
esoteric tomes, gathering rumours from a whisper network, or spying on a
duke, is handled via Investigations.

To start an Investigation, an Errant requires a trove of information,
whether it be access to a vast library, a coalition of friendly street
urchins, a sage, or a spy disguised at court.

The Errant then formulates a query, which an Investigation into the
trove can answer.

The Guide sets a tracker for how many successful attempts will be
required to answer the query completely. Each successful attempt reveals
a portion of information that answers the query, with each success
revealing deeper information, until the final success reveals the
ultimate answer.

An Investigation attempt can be made as an action during a Downtime
Turn. To do so, an Errant rolls 2D6. Having additional corroboratory
troves of information, as well as sages and spies employed (beyond the
ones acting as troves) if their expertise is applicable, will add +1 to
the roll, to a maximum of +3. Poor troves of information can impose a
penalty to the roll, to a maximum of -3.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 7-9 | An obstacle impedes further progress in the Investigation. A new trove of information is required, or a specific task or undertaking must be completed, to continue the Investigation. |
| 2-6 | Investigation attempt fails.                                                                                                                                                           |

A scholar with relevant training in researching the subject of your
query can be hired to conduct Investigations, making Investigation
attempts on behalf of an Errant.

## Proclamations

If an Errant wishes to spread information of some sort, whether it be
disseminating false rumours or championing their glorious deeds, it can
be handled by making a Proclamation.

Two components must be specified: the proposition of the Proclamation,
and its intended audience.

Based on the difficulty of transmitting the Proclamation to the
audience, the Guide sets a tracker for how long the Proclamation will
take to reach them. Having a Proclamation reach almost everyone in a
city (a tier 4 Settlement) would take four successes. Having a
Proclamation reach the ear of the monarch of the nation may take six
successes if the Errant is a lowly gutterborn thief, or one success if
they are an exultant with the ear of the court. Each success means the
Proclamation spreads closer to your audience, with intermediaries on the
information chain being made aware of it.

A Proclamation attempt can be made as an action during a Downtime Turn.
To do so, an Errant rolls 2D6. Each definite article of proof
substantiating the Proclamation adds +1 to the roll, as does each bard
employed, to a maximum of +3. Unsubstantiated, exaggerated, or false
claims may impose penalties on the roll, to a maximum of -3.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 7-9 | Proclamation is met with scepticism, is distorted in some way, or reaches unintended targets. Directed efforts at setting the record straight or substantiating the claims must be made before the Proclamation can continue. |
| 2-6 | Proclamation attempt fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Bonds

An Errant’s relationship with an NPC is described by their bond. This
score can be adjusted freely by the Guide at any time based on the
interactions between the Errant and the NPC.

Once a bond value has been determined, the disposition of that NPC will
be equal to the bond between them and the Errant in the Company with
whom their bond is either highest or lowest, at the Guide’s discretion.

|     |               |                                                                                                                                                          |

| 3-5 | Enemies       | \-                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6-8 | Strangers     | \-                                                                                                                                                       |
| 9   | Acquaintances | Will perform small and costless courtesies.                                                                                                              |
| 10  | Associates    | Will perform minor favours, at a cost.                                                                                                                   |
| 11  | Friends       | Will perform major favours, at a cost; if the NPC belongs to a Faction, and they have enough pull, the Errant gains +1 reputation with that Faction.     |
| 12  | Confidantes   | Will undertake great sacrifice, at a cost; if the NPC belongs to a Faction, and they have enough pull, the Errant gains +2 reputation with that Faction. |

If using the bond for a favour comes at a cost, the NPC will perform
that favour, but it will either lower their bond with that Errant by 1
or the Errant must provide some commensurate service to the NPC. An NPC
will do any favours below the type which comes at a cost freely (e.g. an
NPC whom an Errant is friends with will do minor favours freely, within
reason).

An Errant can also attempt to change their bond with an NPC as an action
during a Downtime Turn. To do so, they must specify whether they wish to
move their score up or down, and how they are doing so. To progress to
either extreme of a relationship will require progressively more
significant actions.

They then roll 2D6, with the Guide applying any relevant modifiers based
on the situation, though not exceeding +/-3 in total.

|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Bond changes by 1 in the direction specified.                                  |
| 7-9 | The Errant must complete a task for (or against) the NPC to change their bond. |
| 2-6 | Bond remains unchanged.                                                        |

cloth, using a piece of chalk to mark it with rows of irregular shapes.
The last figure is a small reptilian creature, half the height of all
the rest, with a long tail. She holds a small covered tray in her hands,
a pattern drawn on the lid.

## Reputation

The Company’s relationship with a Faction is described by their
reputation. This score can be adjusted freely by the Guide at any time
based on the interactions between the Errant and the Faction.

Once a reputation value has been determined, the disposition of an NPC
within that Faction will be equal to the reputation between them and the
Company.

| 9   | Accepted  | Will perform small and costless courtesies.                                                                       |

| 12  | Loved     | Will undertake great sacrifice, at a cost. The Company gains access to any Faction-specific Talents.              |

If utilising reputation for a favour comes at a cost, the Faction will
perform that favour, but it will either lower the Company’s reputation
by 1, or the Company must provide some commensurate service for the
Faction. A Faction will do any favours below the type which comes at a
cost freely (e.g. a Faction that respects the Company will do minor
favours freely, within reason).

An Errant can also attempt to change their Company’s reputation with a
Faction as a downtime action. To do so, they must specify whether they
wish to move their score up or down, and how they are doing so. To
progress to either extreme of a relationship will require progressively
more significant actions.

They then roll 2D6, with the Guide applying any relevant modifiers based
on the situation, though not exceeding +/-3 in total.

Graphic: An elf swings open the door to a tavern, feathered hat in hand,
a gleeful smile on his face, and a friendly finger gun pointing at a
table of seated figures. The serving woman rolls her eyes in
exhasperation. The figures at the table are a rough-and tumble pair,
covered in thick muscles and spider tattoos. One grimaces as his hand is
stabbed by his compatriot, and the stabber glares bulge-eyed and angry
at the elf. In the background, the swinging door has struck another
patron, sending their drink flying and blood spurting out of their face.

## Expeditions

An Expedition is used to extract resources from or settle an area.
Mounting an Expedition can be performed as an action during a Downtime
Turn.

Before an Expedition can be mounted, the area must be cleared by the
Company, whether this is emptying all of the monster lairs within a hex,
Negotiating a treaty with the inhabitants of that area, or obtaining
title from a ruler to settle lands.

Once the area has been cleared, an Expedition can be sent to secure it
via patrols. Attempting to secure one area, whether that is a hex or a
dungeon level, takes one Downtime Turn.

Mounting an Expedition to secure an area requires at least one mercenary
squad to be deployed.

Once an Expedition has been deployed, roll 2D6. Each additional
mercenary squad deployed adds +1 to the roll, up to a maximum of +3 for
fielding a full platoon.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | The area is secured.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7-9 | The Expedition runs into a complication that must be dealt with before the area can be secured, such as encountering a monster lair, dispute with the locals, or Supply route collapse. |
| 2-6 | The Expedition fails to secure the area.                                                                                                                                                |

When securing an area, mercenaries are paid battle wages. In addition,
each squad needs 80 provisions a month, as well as a reliable Supply
route to transport said provisions.

Provisions cost 10 pennies for a day's worth of food, water, and other
sundries, and when purchased reduces a Settlement's available Supply by
4 for the purposes of determining inflation. 1 provision takes up an
Item Slot.

Once an area is secured, mercenaries can set up and hold a base camp.
While holding a base camp, mercenaries are paid regular wages, and only
need 40 provisions per squad a month. A base camp can be held for six
Downtime Turns, after which the mercenaries will begin making Morale
rolls each Downtime Turn to determine if they continue to hold the area.

Once a base camp has been established, the area can be surveyed, which
requires a surveyor. Surveying an area takes one Downtime Turn and will
reveal all the resources in an area, as well as any hidden features.

Once an area has been surveyed, labour efforts such as extracting
resources or building Estates can occur, so long as the base camp
continues to hold.

One labourer can extract 250p value of resources per Downtime Turn. They
can construct buildings at the normal rate.

Each surveyor, labourer, architect, and other Retainers in a base camp
need 6 provisions a month.

Graphic: Three figures in heavy spike-and-skull style armor march
forward in a line. Each surveys the terrain in a different way. One
holds the leash of a demonic pig creature. Another lifts a stone with
their spear to look under it. The third holds a strange device that
strongly resembles a metal detector decorated with skulls. The helm of
the metal-detector wielder has a peculiar device atop it: like a laval
lamp projecting arcs of power across the horizon. In the background are
many more groups like this one, scattered densely across the landscape.

## Infrastructure

Errants can found Settlements or increase the size of existing
Settlements by making investments into infrastructure.

To found a hamlet, the area it is to be built in must be secured and
surveyed, and an Estate of at least 2,000p in value built, around which
the hamlet can be organised.

Founding a hamlet requires it to be constructed using the same process
as constructing an Estate. The cost of construction for a hamlet is
5,000p.

To change the Settlement Type of an existing Settlement, no labourers
are required. However, the Settlement in question must have a route,
either by land, water, or some other method, between it and a given
number of other Settlements .

A tracker is set for the number of successes needed to advance a
Settlement to the next tier. The number of successes is equal to the
tier being advanced to (e.g. expanding a hamlet to a village requires
three successes).

Attempting to improve infrastructure can be performed as an action
during a Downtime Turn. To do so, an Errant pays the base investment
cost for the Settlement Type they are attempting to advance to and rolls
2D6, with bonuses applying for extra expenditures and established
Institutions within the Settlement. These bonuses cannot cumulatively
exceed +3.

An Errant only needs to pay the base investment cost (plus any bonus
expenditures) during the first attempt they make. Successive attempts do
not require payment.

| 7-9 | A setback occurs, which prevents further infrastructure progress until it is dealt with. This may be that the Settlement may not have adequate resources, such as food or water, to expand, or the Settlement's expansion infringes on settled territory, or the lair of a monster or a dungeon is uncovered. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The base investment costs for each Settlement Type are listed below, as
well as any prerequisites.

Graphic: Vista of a sprawling, lopsided town. The buildings are mostly
tall towers, each leaning leaning crookedly in different directions.
Bridges and shafts connect the towers in a confusing mess that would be
hard to navigate. Windows, doors, and arches are spread through the
towers. In the distance are even more of the strange buildings
silhouetted in black.

## Institutions

An Institution is any kind of organisation or long term enterprise.
Examples would include a bar, teahouse, shop, theatre troupe, garrison,
mercenary outfit, gang, guild, orphanage, and so on.

Institutions offer specific benefits to the Errants who have invested in
them. These are customised for each given Institution. For example,
investing in a stagecoach network might allow for more Retainers to be
available for hire, and for henchmen of higher levels to appear in that
Settlement.

Institutions can be categorised into seven different tiers. To found a
tier 1 Institution, an Errant must have some kind of resource available
that would allow them to begin operations. For example, if they wish to
found a cult, they should already have a few followers committed to the
cause. As an action during a Downtime Turn, they can then spend 500p to
establish that Institution in the Settlement they are in.

Errants can also invest, partner in, or assume ownership of pre-existing
Institutions.

To advance an Institution up a tier, if the prerequisites for Settlement
Type are met, an Errant must describe their method for growing the
Institution. They then pay the base investment cost of the tier to which
they are attempting to advance the Institution, and roll 2D6, with
bonuses applying for extra expenditures, to a max of +3.

|     |                                                                                                                                  |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | Institution advances to next tier.                                                                                               |
| 7-9 | A setback occurs, which prevents further growth until it is dealt with; no benefits can be received until setback is dealt with. |
| 2-6 | No progress is made.                                                                                                             |

The base investment costs for each Institution tier are listed below, as
well as any prerequisites.

|                          |         |                                       |                                            |
|--------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1 (inconsequential) | 500p    | No roll necessary.                    | Must be located in a hamlet or larger.     |
| Tier 2 (petty)           | 1,000p  | +1 for each additional 500p spent.    | Must be located in a village or larger.    |
| Tier 3 (middling)        | 2,500p  | +1 for each additional 1,250p spent.  | Must be located in a village or larger.    |
| Tier 4 (notable)         | 5,000p  | +1 for each additional 2,500p spent.  | Must be located in a town or larger.       |
| Tier 5 (influential)     | 10,000p | +1 for each additional 5,000p spent.  | Must be located in a town or larger.       |
| Tier 6 ((in)famous)      | 20,000p | +1 for each additional 10,000p spent. | Must be located in a city or larger.       |
| Tier 7 (iconic)          | 40,000p | +1 for each additional 20,000p spent. | Must be located in a metropolis or larger. |

To relocate an Institution to another Settlement, treat it the same as
attempting to advance the Institution a tier. If the roll is successful,
the Institution is now headquartered in the new location. The Errant and
Guide can determine if it has relocated entirely, or left some auxiliary
or franchise branch behind in the old Settlement.

If an Institution suffers a setback, the Guide may choose to roll on the
following table for inspiration:

|     |                                                                                                                         |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Vicious rumours begin circulating about the Institution.                                                                |
| 2   | Rivals ramp up the competition, lowering prices or offering better services in an attempt to undercut the Institution.  |
| 3   | The Institution is sabotaged by a rival.                                                                                |
| 4   | The Institution's methods, aesthetics, or products become widely imitated and emulated, to the point of oversaturation. |
| 5   | The Institution attracts unwanted legal attention or suspicion from the authorities.                                    |
| 6   | The Institution attracts attention from a criminal outfit, who attempt to muscle in or shake it down.                   |
| 7   | The Institution faces a shortage of some resource it requires to operate.                                               |
| 8   | The Institution has drawn the outrage or condemnation of the public, or at least a very vocal portion of it.            |

Graphic: The Murderwheel. A circular arena surrounded by a low wall,
topped by spikes that curve inward. A variety of weapons and armor hang
along the inside edge of the wall, and two fighters face off against one
another within it. On one side a small figure wearing a fearful
expression. He is scarred, and holds a shield in front of himself as he
advances with his short sword. On the other side is a much larger
figure, powerfully built and wielding a longsword. He appears confident,
pointing at his foe with a mocking expression on his face and
complacently resting his weapon on his shoulder.

## Estates

To build personal Estates, the Errant must acquire the land (via
Expedition or some other means), hire labourers, and pay for the
construction of any buildings.

Construction time is determined by the costs of construction. Each
labourer can construct up to 250p of value per Downtime Turn. Having an
architect attached to a construction project doubles the rate of
construction.

One labourer, therefore, could build a hovel (120p) in less than one
Downtime Turn (about half a month). Building a row house (1,200p)
however, would take them five Downtime Turns. Two labourers could build
a row house in about three Downtime Turns, and two labourers and an
architect could build it in one.

Each building comes with furnishings of appropriate value relative to
the structure. If the Errant wishes to improve the standard of
construction and furnishings, they may pay double the cost of the
building. They may do this as many times as they wish, each time
doubling the cost further.

The basic level of furnishing for a hovel, for example, would barely be
furnished apart from the bare essentials, and those would be of a poor
standard. The basic level of furnishing for a merchant's house would be
quite comfortable, and for an imperial palace would be incredibly
luxurious. An Errant could pay double the cost of the palace, 5,000,000
pennies, to improve it, or pay double that value, 10,000,000, to improve
it even further.

If the Errant wants to add anything into the structure that requires
special craftsmanship, such as traps, secret doors or passageways,
ornate decorations, etc. it adds 1,000 pennies to the cost of the
structure per specific object.

Building special rooms, such as a library, laboratory, or shrine, each
costs 5% of the base cost of the building, and are of a standard of
appropriate value relative to the structure (e.g. a library in a
merchant’s house is rather basic, whereas one in an imperial palace
would be a famed repository of knowledge).

## Domains

Having accrued enough power, some rarefied few worthy Errants may find
themselves rulers of a Domain.

This Domain functions as any other polity in the game world, except for
the important detail that the Errants have direct control of it at the
macro-level, being able to set the code of laws, appoint NPCs to
positions of power, and more.

Domains can be categorised into 10 tiers. A tier 1 Domain is immediately
founded once an Errant has founded a hamlet.

Once a Domain has been founded, it can be improved by investing money
into it, so long as certain prerequisites are met.

A tracker is set for the number of successes needed to advance a Domain
to the next tier. The number of successes is equal to the tier being
advanced to (e.g. expanding a tier 2 Domain to a tier 3 Domain requires
three successes).

An Errant can attempt to improve a Domain as an action during a Downtime
Turn. To do so, an Errant pays the base investment cost for the Domain
tier they are attempting to advance to and rolls 2D6, with bonuses
applying for extra expenditures. These bonuses cannot cumulatively
exceed +3.

An Errant only needs to pay the base investment cost (plus any bonus
expenditures) during the first attempt they make. Successive attempts do
not require payment.

The base investment costs for each Domain tier are listed below, as well
as any prerequisites.

left side, through gradually larger and more densely positioned
structures, until it reaches a walled city of towering cyclopean
structures on the right.

Mundane items & services refers to the chance that the Domain can
furnish specific goods and services. Basic goods & services, like food
or simple blacksmithing, can be assumed since these are necessities, but
specialty items such as, say, siege weaponry or spices will require a
roll.

If the roll is successful, the Domain will always be able to provide
that item or service. If the roll is unsuccessful, then that item or
service cannot be obtained until either the direct action is taken to
make it available (e.g. by recruiting a skilled engineer, or
establishing a trading route for spices), or until the Domain increases
in tier, whereupon it may be tested for again.

Domain armies are made up of citizens who will take up arms to protect
their home, not career soldiers. They can be kept out in the field for a
number of months equal to the Domain’s tier plus two.

Being rulers of a Domain provides Errants with the status of dignitaries
in lands where their Domain’s sovereignty is respected.

If an Errant has left the immediate territories where their Domain is
known, test the Domain’s Renown as you would an Errant’s, treating its
tier as its Renown.

Graphic: A hunched humanoid figure with a vulture's head rides a horse
with taloned bird's feet instead of hooves. Large portions of anatomy
are not depicted: the horse is only its head, mane, and legs. The figure
riding it is only suggested by the position of arm and head. The two may
be emerging ghost-like out of nowhere, obscured by the wild swirling of
the vulture-headed figure's robes. From those robes many wide-eyed
bird's heads protrude, looking every which way.

## Faction Turns

The Guide can use this procedure to simulate the attempts of various
Factions in the world to gain and maintain power.

Each Faction has a number of assets, such as “skilled artisans", “spy
network", or “well-trained troops".

A Faction may set any number of agendas, which are long-term goals. This
may be something like “build a new road", “recruit new troops from among
the villages", or “discover incriminating secrets about the ruler of an
enemy nation". For each agenda, create a tracker, which indicates how
many successes will be needed to achieve that agenda.

Each Downtime Turn (though this is best done by the Guide between
sessions), Factions can take actions to advance their agendas.

First, they allocate any relevant assets to the advancement of their
agendas. Next, they may also allocate any relevant assets to oppose or
aid the agendas of any other Factions.

A Faction rolls a D6 plus the number of relevant assets and minus the
number of assets opposing them.

If they roll a 6 or higher, they mark a success on the agenda tracker.
If they roll a 12 or higher, they mark two successes, and so on.

If they roll a 0, they lose an asset. If they roll -6, they lose two
assets, and so on.

Lost assets are destroyed or captured by opposing Factions, depending on
the circumstances.

A Faction that fulfils an agenda gains a new asset.

Factions can gain and lose assets through the actions of Errants during
play.

## Rivals

When a rival Company arrives in a Settlement, the Guide may make a
Reaction Roll to determine what their overall opinion of the player
Company is. So long as the rival Company is based in the Settlement,
they will also adventure in the area, whether that means making forays
into the local dungeon, or taking the jobs the player Company turns
down.

If the Event Die calls for a rival Company to arrive in a Settlement,
and there is already a rival Company there, the current rival Company
leaves the Settlement for greener pastures, and the newly rolled one
settles in.

An easy way to track the exploits of a rival Company is to put two
entries in the local effects table for nearby wilderness and dungeon
areas. One entry indicates that the rival Company has passed through and
taken all or most of anything of value; the second entry indicates that
the rival Company is currently in the area and the player Company
encounters them.

A second, more involved way may be used between game sessions to track a
rival Company’s progress through a dungeon or on a quest more closely.

Add the total Renown of each member of the rival Company together;
increase this number by 1 for each significant magical item in their
possession. This is their challenge level.

Plot their course through the dungeon or adventure area. Assign each
room or area a challenge level equal to the combined Threat of all the
NPCs and traps located there; assign traps a Threat value equal to their
base DV.

For each room or area the rival Company arrives at, roll 2D6 plus the
difference between their challenge level and the challenge level of the
room or area.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10+ | The rival Company overcomes the challenges of the area easily, and take everything of value                                                                                                        |
| 7-9 | The rival Company overcomes the challenges of the area, but at a cost. Reduce their challenge level by 1. They take everything of value that is not hidden.                                        |
| 5-6 | The rival Company overcomes the challenges of the area, but at a great cost. Reduce their challenge level by 2. They take 50% of the valuables in the area.                                        |
| 2-4 | The rival Company overcomes the challenges of the area, but a Company member dies. Reduce their challenge level by the Renown of that Company member. They take 25% of the valuables in that area. |

If a rival Company’s challenge level is reduced to 0, they flee. A rival
Company can withdraw from the adventure area at any time before that.

Graphic: Two rival adventuring parties stand in opposition to one
another, each member a mirrored version of their counterpart. At the top
of the line are two knights, dressed in completely concealing plate
mail, one holding a halberd and the other a sword. Below them a pair of
pointy-eared folk glare at one another nose-to-nose: one with an
eyepatch and steel skullcap, the other with stark white hair and
jewelry. The next group down are pointy-hatted spellcasters glaring
side-eyed at one another: one a witch smoking a pipe, the other bearded
and holding a crystal staff. At the bottom are two rival thieves, each
covering hoods and masks to cover their faces: in their hands they each
grip one side of a piece of parchment that is tearing down the middle
from the force of their struggle.

## Scourges

While the Event Die creates threats and events in the world, these are
of a fairly random and temporary nature. Scourges simulate an active
long-term danger to a region. This could be the presence of a bandit
lord, a dragon, a lich, or even the spread of an evil cult or
devastating plague.

A newly active Scourge begins with peril 1. Each Downtime Turn, when you
roll the Event Die, interpret it as normal, but in addition, if the roll
is equal to or lower than the peril of an active Scourge in that region,
roll on that Scourge’s malice table. If multiple Scourges are active,
roll on the malice table of each Scourge that was triggered by the Event
Die.

The malice table is a D6 table; each should be tailored to each Scourge,
but in general, a result of 1-5 indicates that the Scourge does
something to affect the region negatively, such as conducting a raid,
eating the livestock, or raising those interred at the local cemetery as
undead servants. A roll of 6 indicates that the Scourge’s peril
increases by 1.

For each peril a Scourge has above 1, place a corresponding locus in the
region that represents the power and influence of the Scourge spreading.
This could be a bandit's camp, a clutch of dragon eggs, or a phylactery.
If that locus is dealt with, reduce the peril of that Scourge by 1.

If the source of a Scourge is dealt while it has active loci, roll a D4
and remove that many loci; this cannot reduce the number of loci below
one. Then, the Scourge re-emerges at one of the remaining loci; a
newcomer takes up the mantle of the bandit lord, an egg hatches and
reaches maturity, and the lich reincarnates.

If a Scourge ever reaches peril 7, it ceases to be a Scourge and becomes
a calamity, something that has totally altered the nature of the game
world. That Scourge is no longer active and triggered by the Event Die,
as the calamity is now the new status quo.

threatening posture, and two angry eyes looking down at an armored
knight. The knight stands in a field of smaller mushrooms. They hold
spear and shield to ready themselves against the threat of the giant
mushroom.

### Example Scourge - The Creeping Rot

An ancient fungal god. Its spores spread and blanket the land. Mycelium
branches through the ground. Colonies expand endlessly. Nothing escapes
them.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | The ground loathes interlopers. Any fungi encountered in this area has a 75% chance of being poisonous, in addition to its other effects.                                                                           |
| 2   | Putrefaction spreads in the air. Each night in the area, D4 rations spoil and become unusable.                                                                                                                      |
| 3   | Crops wither and die. Choose a local Settlement and increase its inflation by one level.                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | Malevolent fungal creatures roam. Each encounter rolled in this area has a 50% chance of including additional fungoid enemies.                                                                                      |
| 5   | Parasitic spores waft through the air. Choose a local Settlement; D10% of its population becomes infected with parasitic mind-controlling spores, and leaves to tend and protect nearby groves of The Creeping Rot. |
| 6   | Increase The Creeping Rot’s peril by 1. Add a new locus in the area: a grove of mushrooms tended to by brainwashed creatures and sentient fungus.                                                                   |

## Downtime Turn Procedure

1.  The Guide declares the start of a Downtime Turn; the timekeeper
    notes down which number Downtime Turn this is.
2.  Company members restore HP and Archetype resources, and any charges
    of True Strikes and Deflects. Remove any remaining Supply from
    inventory.
3.  The timekeeper rolls the Event Die.

-   -   If there are any active Scourges, the Guide Checks if any of
        them have been triggered by the Event Die.
    -   If any setbacks are rolled, the Company decides if they wish to
        postpone taking a Downtime Turn to resolve that setback.

1.  The result of the Event Die is resolved.
2.  Company debt doubles.
3.  The Company hears a rumour.
4.  Free actions, such as shopping, socialising, hiring Retainers, and
    funerals are resolved.
5.  Each Errant declares what they are doing with their action this
    Downtime Turn, and their actions are resolved.
6.  Each Errant declares if they are engaging in Conspicuous
    Consumption, and of what sort, which is then resolved.
7.  Guide resolves any Faction turn actions.
8.  Guide advances the in-game calendar by one month (or appropriate
    amount).
9.  Repeat steps 1-11 until the Company no longer wishes to take
    Downtime Turns.
10. Lifestyle expenses are paid.

muscled wing-arm, ending in a clawed hand.

# Glossary & Index

Alchemy (p. 192) – The creation of items such as potions, pills, and
powders during Downtime Turns (p. 176). alchemical components (p. 143)
harvested and stored in an alchemist’s kit can be turned into alchemical
items with a successful Alchemy Check.

Alignment \[AL\] (p. 198) – A value which describes whether a character
is aligned with the metaphysical forces of Law, Chaos, or whether they
have taken the position of Neutrality; for Errants this is given as a
value of L or C 1-3 for either Law or Chaos, or simply as N for
Neutrality. For NPCs, this is listed as AL.

Ancestry (p. 54) – What type of creature an Errant is. Broken down into
four templates, each of which provide a minor ability: tough, arcane,
cunning, and adaptable.

Archetype (p. 55) – What category of adventurer an Errant is: The
Violent, who excels in combat; The Deviant , who is skilled in a variety
of disciplines; The Occult, who casts arcane magic; and The Zealot, who
performs magic based in faith.

Attack Roll/ATT (p. 149) – When a creature attacks another creature,
they roll their specified amount of damage dice and deal that much
damage (p. 152) to their target. An Attack Roll may be enhanced (p.
150), increasing the size of the dice used as part of that Attack Roll
in favourable situations, or impaired, decreasing them in unfavourable
situations. Characters can attempt gambits, reducing the amount of
damage dealt on an Attack Roll to force their target to make a Saving
Throw (p. 6) to avoid a negative effect. The Deviant (p. 68) is capable
of performing sneak attacks against unsuspecting foes, allowing them to
roll an additional damage die as part of their Attack Roll.

Attribute (p. 6) – Values which represent an Errant’s capabilities;
their physique, skill, mind, and presence.

Block (p. 29) – A value attached to pieces of armour. When an Errant is
the target of an Attack Roll (p. 149) or is otherwise subject to a
negative effect, they may use up any number of blocks from an armour
piece to impair (p. 150) the Attack Roll by 1 step per Block or obviate
the negative effect.

Breakage (p. 33) – A value between 1 and 6 assigned to non-weapon &
armour items which measures their chance to Break when damaged.

Burn (p. 28) – A special type of Depletion (p. 27) used to measure the
remaining duration, as well illumination level, of light sources. Each
point of Burn represents enough illumination for one creature. If the
total amount of Burn is equal to or greater than the number of Company
members, the Company is considered to be in bright light (p. 138); if it
is less than half the number of Company members, or if discreet light
sources are being used, it is considered dim light.

Chase (p. 162) – A variant of the Initiative Turn (p. 146) procedure
used to adjudicate long pursuits or those that take place in abstract
locations. Each Initiative Turn, the character on each side with the
lowest SPD (p. 148) or MV (p. 165) make a movement roll to determine
whether they escape or catch their quarry; a character may choose to
sprint, rolling double their normal amount of movement dice, but must
make a phys Check (p. 6) to do so successfully. At the end of the
Initiative Turn, the side that rolled the lowest result on their
movement roll rolls for a Chase development (p. 163), which affects
them.

Check (p. 6) – The core resolution mechanic of the game, which involves
rolling a D20 above a given value (DV, p. 7) and equal to or below a
second value (Attribute, p. 6). When two characters are competing at the
same task, they make an opposed Check. A frequently made Check is a
navigation Check (p. 121), which is generally a skill Check, made during
Travel Turns (p. 120).

Company – The collective of Errants, as well as their Retainers (p. 50),
animals, and other animals who adventure with them. Also used to
describe analogous collectives of NPCs who are rivals (p. 220) to the
Errants; rival companies have a challenge level used in a procedure to
model their adventures.

Conspicuous Consumption (p. 183) - After an Errant has taken their
action for a Downtime Turn (p. 176), they may choose to engage in
Conspicuous Consumption in order to waste money for the purposes of
gaining XP (p. 63). The four types of Conspicuous Consumption are
carousing, frippery, obscurantism, and do-goodery.

Covenant (p. 108) – The religion, order, or ideology The Zealot (p. 74)
has pledged themselves to. Each Covenant has three or four eminences,
subjects or concepts with which they are associated. The Zealot may
perform Miracles that are associated with the eminences of their
Covenant. Their Covenant also grants them blessings, abilities that they
may always use. These blessings and eminences, as well as the rules for
casting Miracles, are presented in a testament of the Covenant that is
given to The Zealot.

D(x) – refers to a die of a given shape, e.g. D6 is a six-sided die. If
a number precedes the “D” it refers to the number of such dice that
should be rolled, e.g. 4D4 is four four-sided dice.

Deflects (p. 31) - A value of magical armour pieces that have a plus
value (e.g. +1). Each point represents a charge that can be expended to
negate anything that would incur HP (p. 152) loss or other harmful
effect.

Depletion (p. 27) – A value that measures the remaining quantity or
duration of an item, Sorcery (p. 72), or Miracle (p. 108).

Die Of Fate (p. 10) – A D6 that is rolled when the Guide is uncertain of
some aspect of the game world, unrelated to an Errant’s capabilities;
higher rolls denote better outcomes.

Domain (p. 215) – Kingdoms and polities which are ruled by Errants.
Based on their tier, they have a chance to provide the Errant with
mundane items & services as well as deploy an army (p. 216).

Downtime Turn (p. 11) - One of the four types of tracked time, used
during periods in between adventures. By default, assumed to take about
a month. Actions are taken as individuals. Several activities that occur
during Downtime Turns utilise a tracker (p. 176), which records the
number of successful Downtime Turn actions that must be taken for the
activity to be completed. If the Event Die (p. 13) rolls a setback (p.
178), the Company may choose to suspend taking their Downtime Turn to
deal with it; if a setback affects an Errant’s Estate (p. 214),
Institution (p. 210), infrastructure (p. 208) project, or Domain (p.
215) they gain XP (p. 63). During a Downtime Turn, Errants may hold
funerals (p. 182) for deceased Errants, allowing surviving Company
members to purchase their fallen comrade’s XP. When the Company chooses
to stop taking Downtime Turns, they pay lifestyle (p. 186) expenses.

DV (p. 7) – Difficulty value. This is the value that must be rolled
above on a D20 during a Check (p. 6); for any given Check, the DV is
determined by the Guide.

Encumbrance (p. 27) – A value that increases the more Item Slots (p. 25)
an Errant has filled. For every 25% of their available Item Slots that
are filled, their Encumbrance value increases by 1, until all slots are
filled. Any additional filled slots thereafter increases Encumbrance by
1.

Errant – The characters of the players who explore the game space. A
player may make a secondary Errant, known as an adjutant (p. 64), at
Renown 2 (p. 63).

Estate (p. 214) – The domiciles and demesnes of Errants.

Event Die (p. 13) – A die that is rolled every travel (p. 120),
exploration (p. 135), and Downtime Turn (p. 176) which determines what
events or complications occur during that turn; results during travel
and Exploration Turns are encounter, Rest, Deplete/Burn, local effect,
and free. During a Downtime Turn, and the results are encounter,
complication, expiration, trend, intimation, and free. Certain
conditions may result in multiple Event Dice, either positive or
negative, to be rolled.

Exhaustion (p. 26) – A negative condition incurred when a character
undergoes experiences which strain them physically. A point of
Exhaustion fills an Item Slot (p. 25).

Expedition (p. 206) – Sorties conducted by hired mercenaries (p. 52) to
secure an area for the purposes of occupation or extraction during
Downtime Turns (p. 176). Once an area has been secured, a base camp can
be established, allowing for the area to be surveyed and other efforts,
such as construction of an Estate (p. 214) to begin.

Exploration Turn (p. 11) - One of the four types of tracked time, used
when exploring dungeons or other sites of adventure. By default, assumed
to take about ten minutes. Actions are taken as a Company. The Company
decides on a marching order (p. 137), deciding who are in the van, main,
and rear positions and if a scout is posted.

Faction (p. 219) – Organizations and groups that are able to leverage
power to influence the campaign world. During Downtime Turns (p. 176),
Factions can utilize their assets to advance their agendas as well as
stymie or aid the agendas of other Factions. An Errant’s relationship
with a Faction is measured by their reputation (p. 204) score.

Favour (p. 74) – A resource used by The Zealot to increase the result of
their Miracle (p. 108) rolls, or to utilise their Relics.

Feat (p. 66) – Abilities usable in combat by The Violent, which are
activated by using a resource known as combat dice. The Violent begins
play knowing the smite, grit, and dash Feats and when they increase
their Renown (p. 63) may choose to learn additional Feats among the
options of avenge, cleave, command, exert, goad, intimidate, protect,
resist, strategise, and surge.

Grimoire (p. 76) – Arcane objects which contain Sorceries (p. 72). The
nature of the Sorcery is shaped by the Grimoire it resides in; the
essence of a Grimoire determines the function of a Sorcery, while the
sphere determines its subjects. Finally, the themes of the Grimoire
influence the specific nature of the Sorcery.

Guide – The player who adjudicates the game.

HP (p. 152) – The measure of how much damage an Errant or NPC can take.
When an Errant receives damage while they are at 0 HP, they receive a
wound (p. 153) and must make a phys Saving Throw (p. 6) to avoid going
out of action. Some wounds cause an Errant to be on death’s door, which
means they will soon perish if not treated; more grievous wounds will
cause them to become consigned to the reaper, meaning their demise is
imminent and unavoidable.

Impact (p. 8) - Describes the outcome of succeeding on a Check (p. 6).
The default Impact is fair; strong describes a situation where the
outcome of success is more beneficial, while weak is less so.

Initiative Turn (p. 11) - One of the four types of tracked time, used
during moments of intense action. By default, assumed to take about 10
seconds. Actions are taken as individuals. If one group is surprised (p.
146), they are unable to take actions for the first Initiative Turn.
During Initiative Turns, characters may either act quickly, taking one
action, or act slowly, taking two actions, which, along with a dice roll
to see which side acts first, will determine their place in the
Initiative Turn order. Duels (p. 158) and mass combat (p. 160) are
variations of the normal Initiative Turn procedure used for one-on-one
and large-scale combats, respectively.

Institution (p. 210) – Organizations and businesses which an Errant owns
or is invested in; categorized into seven tiers: inconsequential, petty,
middling, notable, influential, (in)famous, and iconic (p. 211).
Institutions provide different benefits to Errants at each tier.

Investigation (p. 200) – Knowledge gathering performed during Downtime
Turns (p. 176). Conducting an Investigation requires a trove of
information, to which a query can be posed.

Item Slot (p. 25) – An abstract representation of an Errant’s ability to
carry items, with one significant item taking up one Item Slot (roughly
either five pounds and/or the size of a human head). An Errant has Item
Slots equal to their phys (p. 6). Three types of Item Slots are
distinguished from the rest; those that represent items a character has
in their hand, items they have handy, and items that are worn.

Jettons (p. 70) – A resource available to The Deviant (p. 68). which
they can spend to reduce the DV (p. 7) of Checks (p. 6) relating to one
of their proficiencies (p. 68). Jettons can also be spent to make
wagers, narrative claims that are related to their proficiencies; when a
wager is made, The Deviant may opt to make a devil’s bargain, allowing
the Guide to also secretly roll a die for the wager, which the player
may opt to choose instead of their own.

Lockpicking (p. 140) – The specific procedure used to open a lock with
burglar’s tools. Each lock requires three actions to be selected in the
correct order; these are twist, tap, and turn. Selecting the wrong
action will cause the lock to become stiff; once a lock has become
stiff, any further incorrect action will make the lock become jammed,
rendering it unable to be unlocked.

Miracle (p. 108) – Magic performed by The Zealot (p. 74) powered by
their faith. Based on the strength of the Miracle to be performed, it
will be categorized into one of five doctrines, which determines the
amount required to be rolled in order for the Miracle to be successful.
The possible results for a Miracle roll are boon, pact, woe, and
apotheosis (p. 112). A special type of Miracle roll, called a
beneficence, can be used to restore HP (p. 152) and wounds (p. 153); the
possible results for a beneficence are boon, mark (p. 114), woe, and
apotheosis.

Morale \[ML\] roll (p. 164) – A value between 1 and 12 that measures an
NPC’s willingness to fight or remain in dangerous situations.

Negotiation (p. 20) - A procedure used to adjudicate high stakes social
encounters. The Company is allowed a number of exchanges based on the
NPC’s disposition; the five types of exchanges are banal, giving, taking
(p. 22), convincing, and bribe (p. 23).

NPC – All the characters who are not Errants, e.g. the characters of the
Guide. An Errant’s relationship with an NPC is measured by their bond
(p. 202) score.

Pace – The rate of movement of the Company during Travel (p. ) and
Exploration Turns (p. 135), expressed as a fraction; the numerator
indicates how many significant areas are traversed, while the
denominator indicates how many Turns it takes to do so.

Player Role (p. 19) – Duties that the players of the game who are not
the Guide assume to facilitate the game running smoothly. These are the
caller, mapper, note taker, quartermaster, and timekeeper.

Position (p. 8) – Describes the outcome of failing a Check (p. 6). The
default Position is risky; shaky describes a Position where the outcome
of failure is less severe than default, while dire is more severe.

Proclamations (p. 201) – Dispensation and dissemination of information
performed during Downtime Turns (p. 176). Conducting a Proclamation
requires a proposition which specifies the message being spread, as well
as its intended audience.

Proficiency (p. 68) – Domains of aptitudes for The Deviant. They may
spend Proficiency points to gain expertise in a Proficiency (Anatomy,
Awareness, Engineering, Fitness, Lore, Sleight-of-hand, Speechcraft,
Stealth, Survival), reducing the DV (p. 7) of all Checks (p. 6) related
to that Proficiency by 2. Spending a Proficiency point on a Proficiency
they already have expertise in grants them the associated mastery
(Chemist, Alert, Locksmith, Fleet-footed, Arcanist, Pack Rat, Socialite,
Assassin, Beast Master) and its unique ability.

Quality (p. 33) – A value that measures a weapon or armour piece’s
durability.

Rarity (p. 32) – A value between 1 and 5 which indexes the availability
of an item to Settlement Type.

Reaction Roll (p. 20) - A roll that is made when the Company encounters
an NPC that determines their disposition.

Relic (p. 74) – Sacred objects The Zealot may attune to, which
determines how many dice they roll when they attempt to perform a
Miracle. Relics are classed as being a blade, chalice, talisman, or
wand, each type of which has an additional special ability that can be
utilized by spending Favour.

Renown (p. 63) – An Errant’s fame, notoriety, and power.

Rest – Any Travel (p. 124) or Exploration Turn (p. 138) where the
Company chooses to forgo their action. During a Rest, an Errant may use
an armour repair kit to restore all their Blocks (p. 29). If an Errant
spends two Travel Turns sleeping (p. 120) at a suitable campsite (p.
120), they gain the benefit of a night’s Rest, during which they remove
a point of Exhaustion (p. 26) and may use a healer’s kit to restore HP
(p. 152) equal to a roll of their damage die (p. 149). If no suitable
campsite is found, the Guide may offer the choice of a few unsuitable
campsites, such as one that is uncomfortable or open (p. 125).

Retainer (p. 50) – NPCs hired by Errants. These are broken down into
four categories: hirelings (such as explorers, porters, and teamsters),
who will adventure but not engage in combat; specialists (such as
accountants, animal handlers, architects, armourers, bards, craftsmen,
factors, jurists, labourers, philosopher, physicians, and sailors), who
do not go on adventures but provide assistance in other ways;
mercenaries (p. 52) who will go on Expeditions (p. 206) or form Warbands
(p. 156); and henchmen (p. 53) (warriors, professionals, and magic
users), who are adventurers that receive a share of treasure and XP (p.
63).

Ritual (p. 197) – Long term magic performed during Downtime Turns (p.
176). Requires the permanent sacrifice of Grimoires (p. 76) or Favour
(p. 74)

Saving Throw (p. 6) – A Check that is made reactively to avoid a
negative effect.

Scourge (p. 222) – Active threats and dangers which grow in power
long-term. Scourges have a peril rating; if the result of the Event Die
(p. 13) for a Downtime Turn (p. 176) is less than that of a Scourge’s
peril, then a roll is triggered on that Scourge’s malice table. For each
peril a Scourge has above 1, a corresponding locus is placed on the map;
neutralizing a locus reduces the peril of a Scourge by 1. If a Scourge
ever reaches peril 7, it becomes a calamity.

Settlement Type (p. 32) – The measure of the size of a Settlement,
broken down into five tiers: hamlet, village, town, city, and
metropolis. The Settlement Type determines how much Supply (p. 29) is
available for purchase each Downtime Turn (p. 176), and the thresholds
for how much Supply can be purchased before triggering inflation (p.
35). Settlements can have their tier increased by investing in
infrastructure (p. 208) projects during Downtime Turns.

Sorcery (p. 72) - Magic performed by The Occult learned from Grimoires
(p. 76). Sorceries can be prepared after a night’s Rest (p. 120); when a
prepared Sorcery is cast, a mind Check (p. 6) is made with a DV (p. 7)
equal to the sum of the Errant’s stabilise and Encumbrance (p. 27)
values. If this Check is failed, that prepared Sorcery is now unstable,
and casting it again risks miscasting. Prepared Sorceries can
deliberately be made unstable in order to perform maleficence or retorts
(p. 73).

SPD \[MV\] (p. 148, p. 165) – The measure of how fast an Errant can move
in Initiative Turns (p. 146). This value defines how many movement dice
an Errant rolls when making a movement roll or shifting; difficult
terrain reduces the distance moved when making a movement roll or
shifting. For NPCs, this value is given as MV, which indicates their
amount of movement dice directly.

Status (p. 151) – Any condition afflicted on an a character, such as
being poisoned, blinded, or frightened.

Supply (p. 29) – An abstract resource that is used to replenish an
item’s Depletion (p. 27) value to its maximum after it has reached 0.
For the purposes of voyages (p. 131) and Expeditions (p. 206), a special
type of Supply called provisions are used.

Talent (p. 188) – A unique ability an Errant may learn from a trainer
during a Downtime Turn (p. 176).

Threat (p. 165) – The measure of an NPC’s power.

Tinkering (p. 191) – The process of customizing items during Downtime
Turns (p. 176). An item may be modified to be more durable,
sophisticated, efficient, or potent but will also receive an attendant
drawback in the process, such as becoming frail, crude, unwieldy, or
ineffective.

Trade (p. 186) – A vocation or profession an Errant can learn, allowing
them to craft items related to it. There are five stages of knowledge in
a Trade, which can be progressed through during Downtime Turns (p. 176):
layman, apprentice, journeyman, master, and legendary artisan.

Travel Turn (p. 11) – One of the four types of tracked time, used when
exploring wilderness or other large distances. By default, assumed to
take about four hours. Actions are taken as a Company; actions include
peregrinate, explore, orient, forage, make camp, take watch, and sleep
(p. 120). The Company decides on a marching order (p. 124), posting a
pathfinder and perhaps a scout. Travel is impeded by inclement and
severe weather (p. 128). Such weather when travelling on water vessels
risks such vessels becoming water damaged, sinking, or shipwrecked (p.
133).

True Strikes (p. 31) – A value of magical weapons that have a plus value
(e.g. +1). Each point represents a charge that can be expended to
maximize the results of an Attack Roll (p. 149).

Warband (p. 156) – A group of mercenaries (p. 52) led by an Errant, who
enhance their leader’s combat effectiveness; classified as either small,
medium, or large based on the number of combatants (excluding the
leader).

Wondrous Item (p. 194) – A bespoke artefact wrought by the hand of a
legendary artisan (p. 187) and fashioned from remarkable materials (p.
194). Contains the seed of magic within, allowing it to become a
Grimoire (p. 76) or a magic item when awakened by a remarkable deed.

XP (p. 63) – Experience points. 1 XP is gained for each penny wasted by
an Errant, or for when an item or investment becomes unintentionally
destroyed or unusable. At given thresholds of XP, an Errant increases
their Renown (p. 63).
