# Covenants & Miracles

## Performing Miracles

The Zealot does not have a set list of spells they can perform, as in
some other games. Rather, they pledge themselves to a Covenant, which
may be the cult of a deity or even a philosophy or ideology to which
they are entirely devoted.

Every Covenant has three or four eminences: subjects or concepts with
which they are associated and over which they hold power. The Covenant
of a sun god, for example, may have eminences in light, fire, and
growth.

The Zealot can at any time attempt to perform a Miracle, a supernatural
acts that is related to their Covenant’s eminences. They may, for
example, make the light of their lantern shine brightly enough to blind
an enemy, or a tree to grow taller so they can climb to a high spot.

To perform a Miracle, The Zealot rolls a D6 plus an additional D6 for
each Relic to which they are attuned, and sum the result. High rolls
indicate success, while low rolls presage failure, doom, or even death.

Miracles are broken down into five power levels known as doctrines. The
more powerful the Miracle, the higher the doctrine, the higher the roll
needed for success.

When The Zealot describes a Miracle they wish to perform, the Guide will
determine what doctrine under which it falls. Each doctrine lists
examples of Miracles that fit into their power level.

Favour can be used to increase the result of a Miracle roll. By
performing actions that please their Covenant, The Zealot may
permanently increase their amount of Favour. The Zealot is free to argue
their case around whether an action ought to award increased Favour, but
the final decision, as always, rests with the Guide.

The Zealot can also attempt to heal their allies by performing
beneficence, a specific kind of Miracle that allows them to heal their
allies.

The Zealot also receives two blessings specific to their Covenant —
special abilities which they can use at will.

The full extent of these blessings, as well as the full rules for
performing Miracles and beneficence, are delineated in the testament of
their Covenant. One such testament follows.

The Guide may wish to have some Covenants prepared for their players to
select from, or they may allow players to create their own Covenants.
For the latter option, there is no need to do this before a session and
to have a full testament created; simply have the player list the
eminences of their Covenant, which should suffice for a session of play,
and write up the testament afterwards between sessions.

Graphic: A kneeling zealot grins with unrestrained glee even as they
undergo a horrific transformation. They hold their hand aloft as it
becomes a cluster of snakes. Snakes emerge also from their pants, and
one of their eye sockets. The zealot wears tattered, patched clothing,
and three holy symbols hang around their neck: a chicken, a snake, and a
bolt of lightning. Their other hand holds a dead chicken, still
bleeding. Broken eggs are scattered at the zealot's feet. A happy little
frog leaps through the scene.

## Testament of The Blessèd Mother

You have made Covenant with the Blessèd Mother, She Whose Body Was
Stolen, Goddess Eminent of Generation, Vision, Time, and Sorrow.

### Blessings

The blessings of the Blessèd Mother grant you special abilities, which
you can perform at will.

-   Unceasing Sorrow - you connect empathically with an ally, sharing
    their pain. When either of you take damage, you may divide it
    between the two of you in any way you wish.
-   Eremitic Eyes - upon observing a subject for a few minutes you can
    determine, in a general fashion, the cause of their suffering.

### Doctrines

Your Covenant grants you the power to perform Miracles, supernatural
acts related to the eminences of your Covenant.

When you wish to do so, roll a D6, plus an additional D6 for each Relic
to which you are attuned. The amount you must roll depends on which
doctrine under which the Miracle falls.

A doctrine is a heuristic for the strength of a Miracle; each lists
examples of Miracles that fall under their purview. The higher the
doctrine a Miracle falls under, the higher the amount you must roll.

Before rolling, you may choose to offer any amount of Favour and
increase your roll by that amount.

Graphic: A four-armed humanoid deity—at once skeletal, insectoid, and
arboreal—stands hip-deep in the sea and wreathed by a glowing halo
against a twilight sky. Her mask-like face is frozen in an imperious
gaze: head tilted downward and over the right shoulder as if to address
a wayward child; lips curved in a delicate frown; two white eyes without
iris or pupil joined by a third oriented vertically in the center of the
forehead, its lids peeled back in a gaping stare. Spiky branch-like
growths shoot up from her neck and upper back in sharp curves and
angles, while a pair of bony arms sprouts from each shoulder socket, the
innermost set bearing wicked spikes at the elbow. Herr chest has no
skin, revealing a cavity filled with tangled veins or vines which
gradually recede behind a trunk-like abdomen half-hidden in shadow.

There are four possible results of a Miracle roll:

-   Boon - your Miracle is successful.
-   Pact - you must agree to form a pact with your Covenant in order for
    the Miracle to be successful. This may require a sacrifice,
    offerings, completion of a task, or some other undertaking
    commensurate to the power of the Miracle performed. While you are
    bound to a pact with your Covenant, you may not form another pact.
-   Woe - your Miracle is unsuccessful. Something has gone awry. Very
    awry. The Guide will roll upon the table of woe.
-   Apotheosis - your Miracle is unsuccessful. Your body erupts, giving
    birth to a physical manifestation of your Covenant; an avatar of a
    deity or belief otherwise made manifest. You are dead.

Graphic: A smiling cultist in a hooded robe holds a burning skull aloft
in one hand, and a match in the other. The match, the cultist's own
head, and the skull form a vertical line in what is presumably a ritual
posture. The cultist wears a toque around their neck, a chain at their
wrist, and a tattered stole marked with strange runes.

Graphic: A topless woman wearing a crown and a grimace plays an
instrument very similar to a violin. Her hands appear to have fused with
the instrument. The bow sprouts directly from the wrist of one arm,
while the strings of the instrument are attached to the remains of
fingers on her other hand.

**Beneficence** - Your Covenant blesses you with the power of
beneficence, allowing you to heal injuries and cure ailments. When you
wish to do so, roll a D6 plus an additional D6 for each Relic to which
you are attuned.

Before rolling, you may choose to offer any amount of Favour and
increase your roll by that amount.

There are four possible results of a beneficence roll:

-   Boon - your beneficence is successful.
-   Mark - your Covenant’s influence manifests as a mutation or phantasm
    attached to the target. The mark lasts until the end of the next
    Downtime Turn. If you used Favour for the roll the mark is
    permanent. You cannot perform beneficence on one marked by your
    Covenant.
-   Woe - something has gone awry. Very awry. The Guide will roll upon
    the table of woe.
-   Apotheosis - the target’s body erupts, giving birth to a physical
    manifestation of your Covenant; an avatar of a deity, or belief
    otherwise made manifest. They are dead.

You heal a number of HP equal to the amount rolled, regardless of the
result of the roll.

You may reduce the amount healed by 10 in order to cure a Status. You
may reduce the amount healed by 20 in order to cure a wound.

Those who are enemies of your Covenant ought not to receive beneficence,
for fear of retribution.

| 10+ | Boon       |
| 7-9 | Mark       |
| 4-6 | Woe        |
| 1-3 | Apotheosis |

### Gaining favour

By performing tasks that please your Covenant or further their goals,
you may permanently increase your amount of Favour. Your Favour only
increases the first time a given task is performed. The completion of a
pact cannot increase Favour. Some examples follow:

#### 1 Favour

-   Convert, through your word directly, a follower to your cult.
-   Make pilgrimage to the Beach of the Blessèd Mother.
-   Solve the plight of a stranger.

#### 5 Favour

-   Give birth to new life.
-   The founding of a new temple or place of worship
-   Uncover great deception for all to see.

#### 15 Favour

-   Alter the course of history.
-   Bring endless misery upon the Carrion Queen.

#### Favour eternal

-   Restore the Blessèd Mother’s body to her.

## Table of Woe

If the result of a Miracle roll is woe, the Guide will roll on the table
of woe for the Covenant. Tables of woe should not be included in the
testament for a Covenant, but the Guide should have them on hand.

The target of a woe is The Zealot if the woe was the result of a regular
Miracle, or the recipient of beneficence if the woe was the result of a
beneficence.

If no stated duration is given, a woe lasts until the end of the next
Downtime Turn. If Favour was used for the roll the effect is permanent.

An example table of woe for the Blessèd Mother follows, as well as a
template table of woe; if the Guide does not wish to devise
individualised tables of woe for each Covenant, they may simply use the
template table and decide on the specifics as needed.

### Table of Woe – The Blessèd Mother

1.  Small thorns grow out of the target’s skin, inflicting D4 damage.
2.  Target begins weeping uncontrollably
3.  Vines begin to grow from the injury, and the target cannot recover
    HP until the vines flower in 2D8 hours or are destroyed. If the
    vines flower, they will naturally fall away, the target will be
    healed of all ailments, and may make a one-time appeal to the
    Blessèd Mother. If they are intentionally destroyed, the vines will
    attack whomever is responsible.
4.  An eye opens on target’s forehead. It is able to see the presence of
    magic.
5.  For the next day, target experiences every moment twice. All damage
    dealt and received is doubled.
6.  Target becomes unable to tell lies but can also sense when others
    are lying.
7.  Incisions appear all over target’s body, and pieces of their flesh
    are cut away. They take D6 damage.
8.  Every month, target will be afflicted with a painful rash. To rid
    themselves of it, they must lay and cover themselves in soil, as
    flowers grow and blossom from their skin.
9.  The target ages D6 years.
10. The skin and flesh of target’s random limb sloughs off, leaving only
    bone behind.
11. Target is blinded for the next hour but becomes able to sense the
    emotions of others.
12. Target becomes unable to speak until they listen to the plight of
    D20 strangers.
13. Half of the flesh on target’s body falls away. Target must make a
    phys Saving Throw or have their phys halved permanently.
14. Target’s bones permanently turn into roots, their flesh into
    tendrils of vine, creepers, and variegated flora sprouting from
    their body.
15. Target grows a single horn from the middle of their forehead. Anyone
    who grasps onto it can commune telepathically with target.
16. Target’s left eye sees 10 seconds into the future, and target’s
    right eye sees 10 seconds into the past.
17. All within 30 feet of the target must make a pres Saving Throw or be
    assaulted with the weight of all the world’s sorrow, permanently
    losing 1D4 points of pres.
18. Target begins to grow musty hair in patches over their body, and two
    bony nubs can be felt on their skull. Each day after the
    beneficence, target must make a phys Saving Throw. If the target
    successfully makes three Saving Throws in a row, the effect ends. If
    they fail three times in a row, they are turned into a black goat
    with a third eye upon their forehead.
19. The next time the target sleeps they must make a pres Saving Throw.
    If they fail, as they sleep, crows will gather around their body and
    pick at their flesh till only a skeleton remains, killing them
    instantly.
20. Target feels something writhing under their flesh. They must make a
    pres Saving Throw. If they fail, their body is consumed by wriggling
    maggots that burst from their skin, killing them instantly.

Graphic: A humanoid figure with a bird's skull head stands in front of a
full moon, resting a flaming long sword over their shoulder. With their
other hand they caress the neck of a nondescript figure sitting on their
knees and leaning against the standing person's thigh. There is a mask
on the ground between them. The night sky is very starry. The
surrounding terrain is a mountainous desert.
