# Gratitudes

This game would not exist today were it not for the multitudes of people
who have been gracious enough to play it with me over the last seven
years. These folks are too numerous to list, but I’d like to thank Jon,
Luna, Markant, and Steve for providing some of the most fun and
memorable gaming experiences I’ve ever had.

Also invaluable in the creation of this game are the MAMR crew. Without
their friendship and support, Errant would not have seen the light of
day, and I would be a much lesser person in toto.

Errant is unashamedly a pastiche and bricolage of various ideas,
mechanics, and philosophies liberally borrowed (or, uncharitably,
stolen) and adapted from members of the online old-school RPG community
(or adjacent thereof). A ludography of those influences follows, but it
is by nature incomplete; there have been so many blogs, adventures, and
systems I have read over the years that have doubtless soaked into my
brain, while any attributionary information has oozed out as if
trepanned. I have also limited the list to works which had a direct
influence in shaping the mechanics of Errant, which discounts the much
greater body of work that served to shape the ethos and philosophy of
the game, in the interest of brevity. Any absences in the following list
are due to ignorance, not malice.
