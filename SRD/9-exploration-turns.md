# Exploration Turns

## Exploration Turn Actions

During an Exploration Turn, the Company may perform one significant
action, such as moving from one room to another, searching or exploring
a room, attempting to force a door open, and so on.

The Company usually acts as a group, but a larger group action can be
broken down into separate individual actions, such as each Errant
examining a different part of the room.

Alternatively, smaller individual actions can be ‘bundled together’ to
create a significant action of the Turn (e.g. one Errant explores a side
passage, one talks to the floating donkey on top of the bookshelf, while
the third sits in a corner and ingests copious amounts of divine
placenta).

If in doubt, the caller is always free to ask the Guide if a given
action will take an Exploration Turn, or for the Guide to inform the
Company if their desired activity counts as their action for the
Exploration Turn.

There is a robe-wearing, staff-wielding occult; a gruff violent carrying
an axe, and a short deviant with her hair and a tight bun and two
daggers held in reversed grips. They glance around cautiously, but do
not see the glinting eyes and sharp teeth leering at them from a nearby
doorway.

## Pace

The rate of movement in Exploration Turns is expressed by Pace, which is
represented as a fraction.

The numerator determines how many significant locations (e.g. a room)
can be travelled, while the denominator represents how many Turns that
takes. The standard Pace is 1/1, representing one significant location
travelled per Exploration Turn.

Pace is modified by the tempo at which the Company chooses to travel, as
well as factors such as the size of areas and whether they have been
previously explored.

|----------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Moving slowly  | x/+1  | +1 positive Event Die. Any hazards or points of interest are automatically detected.        |
| Moving quickly | +2/x  | +1 negative Event Die. No mapping can occur. Hazards or points of interest are overlooked.  |
| Large areas    | x/+1  |                                                                                             |
| Huge areas     | x/+2  |                                                                                             |

## Mapping

When the Company is exploring a dungeon or other location, the Guide
should give them reasonably exact descriptions of the areas in which
they find themselves, including details such as the width, breadth, and
height of rooms and such; the standard Pace assumed in an Exploration
Turn assumes careful mapping and noting of such information.

However, the Guide is under no obligation to correct any but the most
egregious of errors in the map the players create for themselves, unless
failing to do so would hinder play. The Errants should be left to suffer
the consequences of their own actions.

## Marching Order

In enclosed sites of adventure such as dungeons, the Company would be
wise to decide upon their marching order judiciously.

Generally in a 10’ hallway, Errants can stand two abreast.

-   Scout - Errants who are scouting are exploring ahead of the Company
    before signalling them to continue. If the Company declares that
    they are moving from one room to a room on the other end of a
    hallway, for example, the scout would generally first traverse that
    hallway and enter the room, while the rest of the Company stays
    behind in that first room, till the scout gives the all clear. Any
    encounters and encounter signs are found by the scout first, and
    they make any necessary Reaction Rolls. If encountered by NPCs,
    scouting Errants are allowed to make a Check to hide.
-   Van - Errants in the front line of the Company generally end up in
    closest engagement during combat. They are the first to encounter or
    spot any hazards or details ahead of the Company, such as traps,
    characters, hidden treasures, and so on, and make any Checks
    pertaining to those, if necessary. They also will generally make
    Reaction Rolls for any NPC encountered, assuming that those NPC are
    encountered from the front.
-   Main - the middle rank of the Company will often find themselves
    stuck behind the front row in an engagement, and so longer weapons
    such as spears are recommended (as is placing shorter Company
    members in the front). Any hazards or details that might emerge
    within the Company’s midst, say from the floor, ceiling, or walls,
    are within the purview of the characters in the middle rank, and
    they make any relevant Checks or Reaction Rolls that deal with such.
-   Rear - in an engagement, those in the back row will often have to
    resort to missile weapons, Sorceries, and Miracles, though they
    should take care not to catch their comrades in the crossfire
    (placing the tallest members of the Company in the back is generally
    a good idea). Any hazards or details that encroach from behind the
    Company are the responsibility of the back row, as well as any
    Checks or Reaction Rolls thereof.

## Resting

An Errant who spends an Exploration Turn Resting may use an armour
repair kit to replenish their Blocks.

Graphic: A man slumped against a low wooden fence, mopping his brow with
a hankerchief. He is dressed for the road, and surrounded by the
accoutrements of an Errant: sword, shield, pack, and satchel.

## Illumination

Darkness is not a static, passive thing to be easily banished by candle
or torch. Darkness is a giant beast that laps greedily at the pool of
light, always encroaching.

Most adventure sites will be dark, and thus characters require
illumination to see.

Bright light, however, obviates the possibility for surprising foes, and
alerts the denizens of deep and dark places, for whom the shadows hold
no secrets, to the Company’s presence. Generally, if the total amount of
Burn from light sources is equal to or greater than the number of
Company members, the Company is considered to be in bright light.

If the total amount of Burn from light sources is less than half the
number of Company members, the Company is considered to be in dim light.
A single Errant moving with a deliberately discreet form of
illumination, such as a hooded lantern or candle, is also considered to
be in dim light.

## Doors

Graphic: A crenelated stone tower with fleshy arms, legs, and face. It
squats, massive mouth open wide and dongue draped out across the ground.
It looks out from the picture as if annoyed that the viewer hasn't
already walked into its toothy maw.

Doors are the natural enemies of all Errants, jealous guardians of the
treasure that prying hands seek to make their own.

Opening a stuck door is DV 4 phys Check by base, though this may be
increased if the door is heavy, large, and/or barred or otherwise
obstructed.

Each additional Errant assisting in forcing the door open reduces the DV
of the Check by 2, provided their phys is at least twice the DV to open
the door. The number of Errants that can try to force open the door at
once is limited by the door’s width: one Errant per five feet. Using a
prybar reduces the DV by 4, but limits the Errant using it to only
receiving assistance from one other Errant also using a prybar, who will
reduce the DV of the Check by 2. Trying to force a stuck door open takes
one Exploration Turn.

If a door cannot be forced open, the Errants may choose to try to break
it down. A wooden door takes two Exploration Turns to break down; a door
made of stone or metal would take considerably longer. Using
inappropriate items to break down a door, such as weapons, causes them
to lose 1 point of Quality or make a Breakage roll per Exploration Turn.
Breaking open a door causes a great deal of noise, and will doubtless
alert all and sundry nearby to the Company’s presence, and causing +1
negative Event Die to be rolled.

A locked door may be forced open, or an Errant may attempt to Lockpick
it. Successfully picking a locked door does not take an Exploration
Turn, but failing to pick the lock will cause an Exploration Turn to
elapse.

Stuck doors may swing shut behind Errants who pass through them,
becoming stuck once more, unless they are wedged open with spikes.

Doors will happily and freely admit all NPCs not allied with the Company
to pass through.

## Lockpicking

Picking a lock requires burglar’s tools, and selecting the correct
Lockpicking actions in the correct order. These actions are twist, tap,
and turn. Every lock requires three actions to unlock; no action is ever
used in a row. Upon selecting the wrong action, the lock will become
stiff. Once a lock becomes stiff, it remains so until it is unlocked. If
the wrong action is chosen while the lock is stiff, the lock is jammed
and becomes unable to be unlocked.

If a character is trying to open a lock during Initiative Turns, each
Lockpicking action counts as one action.

Locks of the same type are all opened the same way (e.g. if the pattern
for a tin lock is twist, tap, and turn, all tin locks are opened by
twist, tap, and turn).

Modifiers can increase the diversity of lock types without increasing
the complexity of solutions. For example:

-   Cracked - for the first action, any action taken will be correct.
-   Weathered - ignore the first time a lock would become jammed.
-   Secured - the first wrong action causes the lock to become jammed.
-   Spiked - each wrong action deals D4 damage to the lock picker.

either side of the keyhole.

To generate a lock, roll a D12 for each column.

|     |            |                    |           |
|-----|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 1   | Strange    | Twist, Tap, Twist  | Spiked    |
| 2   | Adamantine | Twist, Tap, Turn   | Spiked    |
| 3   | Mythril    | Twist, Turn, Twist | Secured   |
| 4   | Diamond    | Twist, Turn, Tap   | Secured   |
| 5   | Dwarven    | Tap, Twist, Tap    | Weathered |
| 6   | Elvish     | Tap, Twist, Turn   | Weathered |
| 7   | Steel      | Tap, Turn, Twist   | Cracked   |
| 8   | Iron       | Tap, Turn, Tap     | Cracked   |
| 9   | Brass      | Turn, Twist, Tap   | Normal    |
| 10  | Copper     | Turn, Twist, Turn  | Normal    |
| 11  | Tin        | Turn, Tap, Twist   | Normal    |
| 12  | Crude      | Turn, Tap, Turn    | Normal    |

Strange locks are anything out of the ordinary: crystal, organic,
magical, clockwork, etc.

Graphic: A round-topped wooden door set in a stone wall. A knocker hangs
from a menacing face: fanged mouth, glaring eyes, and horns splayed out
around it like the rays of the sun. The flagstone in front of the door
is large and raised above the rest. Almost as if it's a welcome mat...or
a pressure plate.

## Stealth

Moving silently and unseen is a skill Check with a DV equal to the
Errant’s Encumbrance.

Scouting characters are allowed to make a Check to hide reactively when
an NPC is encountered.

When attempting to move stealthily as a group, one member of the group
rolls the Check. The DV is equal to the total Encumbrance of the group,
divided by two.

Factors such as visibility, scent, noisiness of terrain, etc. should be
considered when determining Position and Impact.

Graphic: A lone Errant steps carefully over uneven stone ruins, hand
resting on a precarious column for support. They wear a tunic over a
chain shirt and coif, and hold a longsword at the ready. Atop the
precarious column, not visible to the Errant, a menacing face is
depicted.

## Traps

An Errant who triggers a trap may make a Saving Throw to avoid its
effects. The base DV for avoiding a trap is equal to the level of the
dungeon the trap is located on; if this is not applicable, the Guide may
set whatever DV they feel is appropriate.

Some old traps may have a chance not to trigger; in this case the Guide
may roll the Die Of Fate.

Disarming or re-arming a trap takes an Exploration Turn. If the method
the Errants have described for doing so is risky or uncertain, they make
a Check to see if they are successful.

## Harvesting Materials

Harvesting inert materials from flora and fauna, such as fur, teeth,
leaves, etc., is a generally trivial matter. Each Errant can harvest
about 1 Item Slot’s worth of such components per Exploration Turn.

However, harvesting active alchemical components, such as a spider's
poison sac or a psychedelic mushroom, in a manner that preserves their
properties is a more delicate task. Doing so requires a skill Check
which takes an Exploration Turn, and an alchemist's kit with space to
store the items.

A Check to harvest alchemical components from a creature has a DV equal
to half their Threat.

An alchemist's kit can hold four alchemical components. Most plant
matter counts as a single alchemical component. An alchemical component
harvested from a creature counts as a number of alchemical components
equal to half their Threat.

Graphic: A bearded man in an iron helm lingers over a dead spider. The
beast is easily half his own size. He holds the creature's
freshly-removed guts in his gloved hands.

## Collapsed Structures

Oft has an Errant, in their folly, disturbed the structural integrity of
whatever dank cave or dusty hallway in which they have found themselves,
leaving them trapped in a tomb of their own making. If the Company finds
themselves facing a collapsed tunnel or other structure, all hope of
progress is not lost.

Without any tools, an Errant can manage to dig out about one cubic foot
of rubble per Exploration Turn.

An Errant properly equipped with, say, a pickaxe or a shovel can dig out
about five cubic feet of rubble per Exploration Turn.

Basically: a hole just big enough to crawl through.

Crawling through such a hole does not affect Pace; careful movement and
mapping proceeds at about the same rate of movement as a crawl (though
they obviously will not be able to map or notice relevant features of
the environment while doing so).

To fully clear a collapsed structure takes significantly longer, and
will depend on the specifics of what is being excavated; a general rule
of thumb is that one person with proper tools can dig out about 150
cubic feet per day (such an excavation is a good job for an Expedition).

Graphic: Three Errants work to dig out some rubble, their work
illuminated by lantern light. One figure squats down on a pile of loose
refuse and stone, struggling to lift a large rock. Another figure,
shirtless, uses a shovel to dig at gravel and dirt, throwing it over his
shoulder. The last figure takes cover as the flying dirt and gravel goes
over their head. The room they work in has half-collapsed with one of
the pillars tilted to one side, covered with treasure and refuse alike,
ranging from swords to music boxes to lanterns.

## Exploration Turn Procedure

1.  The Guide declares the start of an Exploration Turn; the timekeeper
    notes down which number Exploration Turn this is.
2.  The caller relays the Company’s action for the Exploration Turn to
    the Guide.

-   -   If they are moving, the caller declares the Pace they are moving
        at, and the Guide makes any other necessary adjustments to their
        Pace.

1.  The timekeeper rolls the Event Die.
2.  The result of the Event Die and the Company’s action are resolved.
