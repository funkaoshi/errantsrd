Both are outfitted for battle, strapped with leather, plate metal, and
furs that billow in the wind. The Errant sits full on the ground using
both feet to brace his crossbow while he pulls the cord back with his
hands. The clouds above rush by with the wind.

Graphic: A busy city market. Blocky buildings are capped by domed roofs.
A fruit vendor leans over his crates of produce to hold out one piece
enticingly towards a woman and her daughter. A woman in a stand filled
with stacked and hanging pottery looms near a customer inspecting one of
her pieces. Many stalls and customers populate the space, their specific
activities indistinct, their structures made of makeshift materials and
easily disassembled.

Prices for buildings are the costs of construction. Prices to buy or
rent may be more or less. Rarity for buildings is the Settlement Type in
which they may be bought or rented; buildings can otherwise be built in
any Settlement Type, provided land and labour is available. Buildings
always carry their original worth for resale.

Retainers marked with an † can be hired daily at 1/10 of monthly wage
per day.

Henchmen are classed characters and do not receive a wage; rather, they
will receive a portion of Company treasure as agreed upon between them
and their employers.

Prices do not include room, board, supplies, etc.

## Retainers

Difficult as it is to imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to
be under the employ of an Errant, such strange occurrences do happen,
and with alarming frequency too! A good thing, then, for without the
exploitation of human capital no Errant could ever hope for even a
modicum of success.

There are four different categories of Retainers.

### Hirelings

Hirelings will go on adventures with an Errant, but will not participate
in combat. An Errant can have a number of hirelings in their employ
equal to their pres.

Hirelings, unless otherwise noted, have an 8 in all their attributes.

Hirelings are listed in order of Rarity, in order to facilitate random
determination by the Guide when necessary.

1.  Porter: Will bear torches, shields, and any other equipment or
    luggage an Errant chooses to saddle them with. They have 4 more Item
    Slots than a normal hireling (this does not affect their phys or
    HP).
2.  Teamster: Drives vehicles in the wilderness and secures the load of
    pack animals. Pack animals that are not being ridden have their Item
    Slots increased by 20, and vehicles have their Breakage reduced by
    1.
3.  Explorer: When travelling with the Company in an area with which
    they are familiar, they reduce the DV of all navigation Checks by 4.
    They will also note any points of interest and answer questions
    about the area.

### Specialists

Specialists do not go on adventures, instead remaining in a Settlement
and performing specific functions. An Errant can have a number of
specialists in their employ equal to their pres.

Specialists are listed in order of Rarity, in order to facilitate random
determination by the Guide when necessary.

1.  Labourer: Perform manual labour, such as building structures,
    harvesting resources, clearing obstructions, etc.
2.  Bard: Each bard employed provides one rumour per Downtime Turn. Each
    bard employed also adds +1 to a Proclamation roll, to a max of +3.
3.  Sailor: Needed to crew marine vessels for sailing. Each crew needs a
    captain.
4.  Surveyor: Needed to survey an area during Expeditions.
5.  Animal handler: Can train animals.
6.  Armourer: Can make crafting rolls for weapons and armour. Restores
    Quality of all weapons and armour for the Company at the end of a
    Downtime Turn.
7.  Craftsman: Can make crafting rolls for their profession.
8.  Factor: Buys and sells items for you. Can buy and sell items of a
    Rarity value 1 higher than the current Settlement, given a Downtime
    Turn, using normal Rarity rates. Can also find a buyer for treasure.
    Payment is based on money handled per transaction.
9.  Jurist: Necessary to bring a legal trial to action or to mount a
    defence. Each additional jurist adds +1 to the roll, to a max of 3.
10. Physician: Can treat one disease or wound per Downtime Turn.

Graphic: A tooth. Specifically, a molar.

1.  Scholar: Can conduct Investigations.
2.  Spy: Allows for the target on whom they are spying to become a
    source for Investigations. Each additional spy that is engaged to
    spy on the same target adds +1 to the roll for Investigation
    attempts, to a max of +3.
3.  Accountant: Keeps track of an Errant’s expenses, reducing the amount
    of money lost due to lifestyle from half to a quarter. Payment is
    based on the amount of money left at the end of a Downtime Turn
    before it is reduced due to lifestyle.
4.  Architect: Doubles rate of construction for buildings.
5.  Philosopher: Can create alchemical items.
6.  Sage: Can be a source for Investigations for their area of
    expertise. Each additional sage with relevant expertise for an
    Investigation adds +1 to the roll for Investigation attempts, to a
    max of +3.

### Mercenaries

Mercenaries are hired soldiers who will not go into dungeons, but will
form Warbands, go to battle, and serve in Expeditions. When directly
commanding mercenaries in a Warband, an Errant can command a number of
mercenaries equal to their pres.

-   20 mercenaries make a squad; of these, one must be a lieutenant.
-   80 mercenaries make a platoon; of these, four must be lieutenants
    and one a captain.
-   Battle prices are double the normal rate listed.

Graphic: Three people sitting on steps. A man on the left, smiling with
his left foot on the step above his right foot, is holding a small bag
of money to the Errants on the right. One moustached Errant wields an
oval shield and an ornate polearm with two small blades poking out from
underneath the tip; he wears a crown with a cross on top, and has
regal-looking attire. Sitting behind him is the other Errant wearing a
breastplate and a hairband around her short hair; her left arm is
wrapped around a large sheathed sword, and to her right is a small glass
bottle.

### Henchmen

Henchmen are NPCs who will delve into dungeons to adventure and engage
in combat; they receive at least half a share of treasure, half of which
they gain as XP. If a henchman's Renown ever exceeds that of the Errant
who hired them, they will depart the Company. An Errant can have a
number of henchmen equal to their pres divided by four.

Henchmen have randomly determined attributes in the same manner as
Errants, and use simplified versions of Errant Archetypes, in order to
facilitate ease of play. They come in three varieties.

-   Warriors have a D8 damage die. They have a number of combat dice
    equal to their Renown, and know the smite, grit, and dash Feats.
    Combat dice replenish after a night's Rest.
-   Professionals have a D6 damage die and can sneak attack. They have a
    number of proficiencies equal to their Renown; they cannot gain in
    any of these proficiencies. Once between Downtime Turns, they may
    choose to automatically succeed on a Check related to one of their
    proficiencies a number of times equal to their Renown.
-   Magic users have a D4 damage die. Each magic user has a particular
    specialty, such as illusions, pyromancy, necromancy, and so on. A
    magic user has a number of powers related to their specialty equal
    to their Renown; these are simple abilities with one or two sentence
    effects such as “creates a wall of hypnotic lights", “hurls a great
    ball of fire", “raises a number of corpses from the dead", and so
    on. Each of their powers must be distinct. Each day, they may use
    each of their powers once if they have had a night’s Rest. In terms
    of damage, healing, creatures affected, range, and so on, powers
    scale the same as Sorceries.
